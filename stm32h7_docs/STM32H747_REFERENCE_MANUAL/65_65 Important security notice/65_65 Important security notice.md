## **65 Important security notice**

The STMicroelectronics group of companies (ST) places a high value on product security, which is why the ST product(s) identified in this documentation may be certified by various security certification bodies and/or may implement our own security measures as set forth herein. However, no level of security certification and/or built-in security measures can guarantee that ST products are resistant to all forms of attacks. As such, it is the responsibility of each of ST's customers to determine if the level of security provided in an ST product meets the customer needs both in relation to the ST product alone, as well as when combined with other components and/or software for the customer end product or application. In particular, take note that:

- ST products may have been certified by one or more security certification bodies, such as Platform Security Architecture (www.psacertified.org) and/or Security Evaluation standard for IoT Platforms (www.trustcb.com). For details concerning whether the ST product(s) referenced herein have received security certification along with the level and current status of such certification, either visit the relevant certification standards website or go to the relevant product page on *www.st.com* for the most up to date information. As the status and/or level of security certification for an ST product can change from time to time, customers should re-check security certification status/level as needed. If an ST product is not shown to be certified under a particular security standard, customers should not assume it is certified.
- Certification bodies have the right to evaluate, grant and revoke security certification in relation to ST products. These certification bodies are therefore independently responsible for granting or revoking security certification for an ST product, and ST does not take any responsibility for mistakes, evaluations, assessments, testing, or other activity carried out by the certification body with respect to any ST product.
- Industry-based cryptographic algorithms (such as AES, DES, or MD5) and other open standard technologies which may be used in conjunction with an ST product are based on standards which were not developed by ST. ST does not take responsibility for any flaws in such cryptographic algorithms or open technologies or for any methods which have been or may be developed to bypass, decrypt or crack such algorithms or technologies.
- While robust security testing may be done, no level of certification can absolutely guarantee protections against all attacks, including, for example, against advanced attacks which have not been tested for, against new or unidentified forms of attack, or against any form of attack when using an ST product outside of its specification or intended use, or in conjunction with other components or software which are used by customer to create their end product or application. ST is not responsible for resistance against such attacks. As such, regardless of the incorporated security features and/or any information or support that may be provided by ST, each customer is solely responsible for determining if the level of attacks tested for meets their needs, both in relation to the ST product alone and when incorporated into a customer end product or application.
- All security features of ST products (inclusive of any hardware, software, documentation, and the like), including but not limited to any enhanced security features added by ST, are provided on an "AS IS" BASIS. AS SUCH, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ST DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, unless the applicable written and signed contract terms specifically provide otherwise.
