# **17 Basic direct memory access controller (BDMA)**

# **17.1 Introduction**

The basic direct memory access (BDMA) controller is a bus master and system peripheral.

The BDMA is used to perform programmable data transfers between memory-mapped peripherals and/or memories, upon the control of an off-loaded CPU.

The BDMA controller features a single AHB master architecture.

There is one instance of BDMA with 8 channels.

Each channel is dedicated to managing memory access requests from one or more peripherals. The BDMA includes an arbiter for handling the priority between DMA requests.

# **17.2 BDMA main features**

- Single AHB master
- Peripheral-to-memory, memory-to-peripheral, memory-to-memory and peripheral-toperipheral data transfers
- Access to D3 domain SRAM and AHB/APB peripherals (BDMA)
- All BDMA channels independently configurable:
  - Each channel is associated either with a DMA request signal coming from a peripheral, or with a software trigger in memory-to-memory transfers. This configuration is done by software.
  - Priority between the requests is programmable by software (4 levels per channel: very high, high, medium, low) and by hardware in case of equality (such as request to channel 1 has priority over request to channel 2).
  - Transfer size of source and destination are independent (byte, half-word, word), emulating packing and unpacking. Source and destination addresses must be aligned on the data size.
  - Support of transfers from/to peripherals to/from memory with circular buffer management
  - Programmable number of data to be transferred: 0 to 216 1
- Generation of an interrupt request per channel. Each interrupt request is caused from any of the three DMA events: transfer complete, half transfer, or transfer error.

# **17.3 BDMA implementation**

### **17.3.1 BDMA**

BDMA is implemented with the hardware configuration parameters shown in the table below.

**Table 120. BDMA implementation**

| Feature                            | BDMA |  |  |  |  |  |
|------------------------------------|------|--|--|--|--|--|
| Number of channels (double-buffer) | 8    |  |  |  |  |  |

# **17.3.2 BDMA request mapping**

The BDMA controller is connected to DMA requests from the AHB/APB peripherals through the DMAMUX peripheral.

For the mapping of the different requests, refer to the *Section 18.3: DMAMUX implementation*.

# **17.4 BDMA functional description**

### **17.4.1 BDMA block diagram**

The BDMA block diagram is shown in the figure below.

**Figure 89. BDMA block diagram** 

The BDMA controller performs direct memory transfer by sharing the AHB system bus with other system masters. The bus matrix implements round-robin scheduling. DMA requests may stop the CPU access to the system bus for a number of bus cycles, when CPU and BDMA target the same destination (memory or peripheral).

The BDMA controller is connected to DMA requests from the AHB/APB peripherals through the DMAMUX peripheral.

According to its configuration through the AHB slave interface, the BDMA controller arbitrates between the DMA channels and their associated received requests. The BDMA controller also schedules the DMA data transfers over the single AHB port master.

The BDMA controller generates an interrupt per channel to the interrupt controller.

### **17.4.2 BDMA pins and internal signals**

| Signal name | Signal type | Description                |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| bdma_req[x] | Input       | BDMA channel x request     |
| bdma_ack[x] | Output      | BDMA channel x acknowledge |
| bdma_it[x]  | Output      | BDMA channel x interrupt   |

**Table 121. BDMA internal input/output signals** 

### **17.4.3 BDMA transfers**

The software configures the BDMA controller at channel level, in order to perform a block transfer, composed of a sequence of AHB bus transfers.

A BDMA block transfer may be requested from a peripheral, or triggered by the software in case of memory-to-memory transfer.

After an event, the following steps of a single BDMA transfer occur:

- 1. The peripheral sends a single DMA request signal to the BDMA controller.
- 2. The BDMA controller serves the request, depending on the priority of the channel associated to this peripheral request.
- 3. As soon as the BDMA controller grants the peripheral, an acknowledge is sent to the peripheral by the BDMA controller.
- 4. The peripheral releases its request as soon as it gets the acknowledge from the BDMA controller.
- 5. Once the request is deasserted by the peripheral, the BDMA controller releases the acknowledge.

The peripheral may order a further single request and initiate another single BDMA transfer.

The request/acknowledge protocol is used when a peripheral is either the source or the destination of the transfer. For example, in case of memory-to-peripheral transfer, the peripheral initiates the transfer by driving its single request signal to the BDMA controller. The BDMA controller reads then a single data in the memory and writes this data to the peripheral.

For a given channel x, a BDMA block transfer consists of a repeated sequence of:

- a single BDMA transfer, encapsulating two AHB transfers of a single data, over the BDMA AHB bus master:
  - a single data read (byte, half-word or word) from the peripheral data register or a location in the memory, addressed through an internal current peripheral/memory address register.
    - The start address used for the first single transfer is the base address of the peripheral or memory, and is programmed in the BDMA\_CPARx or BDMA\_CM0/1ARx register.
  - a single data write (byte, half-word or word) to the peripheral data register or a location in the memory, addressed through an internal current peripheral/memory address register.
    - The start address used for the first transfer is the base address of the peripheral or memory, and is programmed in the BDMA\_CPARx or BDMA\_CM0/1ARx register.
- post-decrementing of the programmed BDMA\_CNDTRx register This register contains the remaining number of data items to transfer (number of AHB 'read followed by write' transfers).

This sequence is repeated until BDMA\_CNDTRx is null.

*Note: The AHB master bus source/destination address must be aligned with the programmed size of the transferred single data to the source/destination.*

# **17.4.4 BDMA arbitration**

The BDMA arbiter manages the priority between the different channels.

When an active channel x is granted by the arbiter (hardware requested or software triggered), a single BDMA transfer is issued (such as a AHB 'read followed by write' transfer of a single data). Then, the arbiter considers again the set of active channels and selects the one with the highest priority.

The priorities are managed in two stages:

- software: priority of each channel is configured in the BDMA\_CCRx register, to one of the four different levels:
  - very high
  - high
  - medium
  - low
- hardware: if two requests have the same software priority level, the channel with the lowest index gets priority. For example, channel 2 gets priority over channel 4.

When a channel x is programmed for a block transfer in memory-to-memory mode, re arbitration is considered between each single BDMA transfer of this channel x. Whenever there is another concurrent active requested channel, the BDMA arbiter automatically alternates and grants the other highest-priority requested channel, which may be of lower priority than the memory-to-memory channel.

# **17.4.5 BDMA channels**

Each channel may handle a BDMA transfer between a peripheral register located at a fixed address, and a memory address. The amount of data items to transfer is programmable.

![](_page_3_Picture_24.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 711/3556

The register that contains the amount of data items to transfer is decremented after each transfer.

A DMA channel is programmed at block transfer level.

### **Programmable data sizes**

The transfer sizes of a single data (byte, half-word, or word) to the peripheral and memory are programmable through, respectively, the PSIZE[1:0] and MSIZE[1:0] fields of the BDMA\_CCRx register.

### **Pointer incrementation**

The peripheral and memory pointers may be automatically incremented after each transfer, depending on the PINC and MINC bits of the BDMA\_CCRx register.

If the **incremented mode** is enabled (PINC or MINC set to 1), the address of the next transfer is the address of the previous one incremented by 1, 2 or 4, depending on the data size defined in PSIZE[1:0] or MSIZE[1:0]. The first transfer address is the one programmed in the BDMA\_CPARx or BDMA\_CM0/1ARx register. During transfers, these registers keep the initially programmed value. The current transfer addresses (in the current internal peripheral/memory address register) are not accessible by software.

If the channel x is configured in **non-circular mode**, no DMA request is served after the last data transfer (once the number of single data to transfer reaches zero). The DMA channel must be disabled in order to reload a new number of data items into the BDMA\_CNDTRx register.

*Note: If the channel x is disabled, the BDMA registers are not reset. The DMA channel registers (BDMA\_CCRx, BDMA\_CPARx and BDMA\_CM0ARx) retain the initial values programmed during the channel configuration phase.*

> In **circular mode**, after the last data transfer, the BDMA\_CNDTRx register is automatically reloaded with the initially programmed value. The current internal address registers are reloaded with the base address values from the BDMA\_CPARx and BDMA\_CM0/1ARx registers.

![](_page_4_Picture_13.jpeg)

### **Channel configuration procedure**

The following sequence is needed to configure a DMA channel x:

- 1. Set the peripheral register address in the BDMA\_CPARx register. The data is moved from/to this address to/from the memory after the peripheral event, or after the channel is enabled in memory-to-memory mode.
- 2. Set the memory address in the BDMA\_CM0ARx register. The data is written to/read from the memory after the peripheral event or after the channel is enabled in memory-to-memory mode.
- 3. Configure the total number of data to transfer in the BDMA\_CNDTRx register. After each data transfer, this value is decremented.
- 4. Configure the parameters listed below in the BDMA\_CCRx register:
  - the channel priority
  - the data transfer direction
  - the circular mode
  - the double-buffer mode
  - the peripheral and memory incremented mode
  - the peripheral and memory data size
  - the interrupt enable at half and/or full transfer and/or transfer error
- 5. Activate the channel by setting the EN bit in the BDMA\_CCRx register.

A channel, as soon as enabled, may serve any BDMA request from the peripheral connected to this channel, or may start a memory-to-memory block transfer.

*Note: The two last steps of the channel configuration procedure may be merged into a single access to the BDMA\_CCRx register, to configure and enable the channel.*

### **Channel state and disabling a channel**

A channel x in active state is an enabled channel (read BDMA\_CCRx.EN = 1). An active channel x is a channel that must have been enabled by the software (BDMA\_CCRx.EN set to 1) and afterwards with no occurred transfer error (BDMA\_ISR.TEIFx = 0). In case there is a transfer error, the channel is automatically disabled by hardware (BDMA\_CCRx.EN = 0).

The three following use cases may happen:

• Suspend and resume a channel

This corresponds to the two following actions:

- An active channel is disabled by software (writing BDMA\_CCRx.EN = 0 whereas BDMA\_CCRx.EN = 1).
- The software enables the channel again (BDMA\_CCRx.EN set to 1) without reconfiguring the other channel registers (such as BDMA\_CNDTRx, BDMA\_CPARx and BDMA\_CM0/1ARx).

This case is not supported by the BDMA hardware, that does not guarantee that the remaining data transfers are performed correctly.

• Stop and abort a channel

If the application does not need any more the channel, this active channel can be disabled by software. The channel is stopped and aborted but the BDMA\_CNDTRx

![](_page_5_Picture_29.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 713/3556

register content may not correctly reflect the remaining data transfers versus the aborted source and destination buffer/register.

• Abort and restart a channel

This corresponds to the software sequence: disable an active channel, then reconfigure the channel and enable it again.

This is supported by the hardware if the following conditions are met:

- The application guarantees that, when the software is disabling the channel, a DMA data transfer is not occurring at the same time over its master port. For example, the application can first disable the peripheral in DMA mode, in order to ensure that there is no pending hardware DMA request from this peripheral.
- The software must operate separated write accesses to the same BDMA\_CCRx register: First disable the channel. Second reconfigure the channel for a next block transfer including the BDMA\_CCRx if a configuration change is needed. There are read-only BDMA\_CCRx register fields when BDMA\_CCRx.EN=1. Finally enable again the channel.

When a channel transfer error occurs, the EN bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register is cleared by hardware. This EN bit can not be set again by software to re-activate the channel x, until the TEIFx bit of the BDMA\_CxISR register is set.

### **Circular mode (in memory-to-peripheral/peripheral-to-memory transfers)**

The circular mode is available to handle circular buffers and continuous data flows (such as ADC scan mode). This feature is enabled using the CIRC bit in the BDMA\_CCRx register.

*Note: The circular mode must not be used in memory-to-memory mode. Before enabling a channel in circular mode (CIRC = 1), the software must clear the MEM2MEM bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register. When the circular mode is activated, the amount of data to transfer is automatically reloaded with the initial value programmed during the channel configuration phase, and the DMA requests continue to be served.*

> *In order to stop a circular transfer, the software needs to stop the peripheral from generating DMA requests (such as quit the ADC scan mode), before disabling the DMA channel. The software must explicitly program the BDMA\_CNDTRx value before starting/enabling a transfer, and after having stopped a circular transfer.*

### **Memory-to-memory mode**

The BDMA channels may operate without being triggered by a request from a peripheral. This mode is called memory-to-memory mode, and is initiated by software.

If the MEM2MEM bit in the BDMA\_CCRx register is set, the channel, if enabled, initiates transfers. The transfer stops once the BDMA\_CNDTRx register reaches zero.

*Note: The memory-to-memory mode must not be used in circular mode. Before enabling a channel in memory-to-memory mode (MEM2MEM = 1), the software must clear the CIRC bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register.*

### **Double-buffer mode (in memory-to-peripheral and peripheral-to memory transfers)**

The BDMA channels can operate in double-buffer mode.

The difference compared to a regular operation is that the BDMA controller toggles between two memory address pointers at the end of each BDMA transfer, thus accessing two memory areas in an alternate way. This allows the software to access one of the two

![](_page_6_Picture_23.jpeg)

memory areas while the BDMA controller accesses the other one. The double-buffer mode transfer operates in both directions, so the target memory can be either the source or the destination.

The double-buffer mode is configured by setting both the DBM and CIRC bits of the BDMA\_CCRx register.

*Note: The double-buffer mode must not be used in memory-to-memory mode. Before enabling a channel in double-buffer mode (DBM = 1), the software has to configure appropriately the MEM2MEM bit (MEM2MEM = 0).*

> The steps described below allow the configuration of a BDMA channel x in double-buffer mode:

- Set the DBM and CIRC bits and clear the MEM2MEM bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register. The circular mode is then activated for the swap mechanism to occur.
- Configure the second memory address register BDMA\_CM1ARx.
- Continue with the regular channel configuration procedure, and lastly, activate the channel by setting the EN bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register. The first BDMA transfer target memory of the corresponding BDMA channel x, is given by the CT bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register.

*Note: Independently from the value of DBM bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register, if CT = 1, the memory address pointer for the BDMA transfer is defined by BDMA\_CM1ARx, and not by BDMA\_CM0ARx.*

### **Peripheral-to-peripheral mode**

Any BDMA channel can operate in peripheral-to-peripheral mode:

- when the hardware request from a peripheral is selected to trigger the BDMA channel This peripheral is the BDMA initiator and paces the data transfer from/to this peripheral to/from a register belonging to another memory-mapped peripheral (this one being not configured in DMA mode).
- when no peripheral request is selected and connected to the BDMA channel The software configures a register-to-register transfer by setting the MEM2MEM bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register.

### **Programming transfer direction, assigning source/destination**

The value of the DIR bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register sets the direction of the transfer, and consequently, it identifies the source and the destination, regardless the source/destination type (peripheral or memory):

- **DIR = 1** defines typically a memory-to-peripheral transfer. More generally, if DIR = 1:
  - The **source** attributes are defined by the BDMA\_MARx register, the MSIZE[1:0] field and MINC bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register. Regardless of their usual naming, these 'memory' register, field and bit are used to define the source peripheral in peripheral-to-peripheral mode.
  - The **destination** attributes are defined by the BDMA\_PARx register, the PSIZE[1:0] field and PINC bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register.

![](_page_7_Picture_21.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 715/3556

Regardless of their usual naming, these 'peripheral' register, field and bit are used to define the destination memory in memory-to-memory mode.

- **DIR = 0** defines typically a peripheral-to-memory transfer. More generally, if DIR = 0:
  - The **source** attributes are defined by the BDMA\_PARx register, the PSIZE[1:0] field and PINC bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register. Regardless of their usual naming, these 'peripheral' register, field and bit are used to define the source memory in memory-to-memory mode
  - The **destination** attributes are defined by the BDMA\_MARx register, the MSIZE[1:0] field and MINC bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register. Regardless of their usual naming, these 'memory' register, field and bit are used to define the destination peripheral in peripheral-to-peripheral mode.

### **17.4.6 BDMA data width, alignment and endianness**

When PSIZE[1:0] and MSIZE[1:0] are not equal, the BDMA controller performs some data alignments as described in the table below.

**Table 122. Programmable data width and endian behavior (when PINC = MINC = 1)**

**Table 122. Programmable data width and endian behavior (when PINC = MINC = 1) (continued)**

### **Addressing AHB peripherals not supporting byte/half-word write transfers**

When the BDMA controller initiates an AHB byte or half-word write transfer, the data are duplicated on the unused lanes of the AHB master 32-bit data bus (HWDATA[31:0]).

When the AHB slave peripheral does not support byte or half-word write transfers and does not generate any error, the BDMA controller writes the 32 HWDATA bits as shown in the two examples below:

- To write the half-word 0xABCD, the BDMA controller sets the HWDATA bus to 0xABCDABCD with a half-word data size (HSIZE = HalfWord in AHB master bus).
- To write the byte 0xAB, the BDMA controller sets the HWDATA bus to 0xABABABAB with a byte data size (HSIZE = Byte in the AHB master bus).

Assuming the AHB/APB bridge is an AHB 32-bit slave peripheral that does not take into account the HSIZE data, any AHB byte or half-word transfer is changed into a 32-bit APB transfer as described below:

- An AHB byte write transfer of 0xB0 to one of the 0x0, 0x1, 0x2 or 0x3 addresses, is converted to an APB word write transfer of 0xB0B0B0B0 to the 0x0 address.
- An AHB half-word write transfer of 0xB1B0 to the 0x0 or 0x2 addresses, is converted to an APB word write transfer of 0xB1B0B1B0 to the 0x0 address.

## **17.4.7 BDMA error management**

A BDMA transfer error is generated when reading from or writing to a reserved address space. When a BDMA transfer error occurs during a BDMA read or write access, the faulty channel x is automatically disabled through a hardware clear of its EN bit in the corresponding BDMA\_CCRx register.

The TEIFx bit of the BDMA\_ISR register is set. An interrupt is then generated if the TEIE bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register is set.

The EN bit of the BDMA\_CCRx register can not be set again by software (channel x reactivated) until the TEIFx bit of the BDMA\_ISR register is cleared (by setting the CTEIFx bit of the BDMA\_IFCR register).

When the software is notified with a transfer error over a channel which involves a peripheral, the software has first to stop this peripheral in DMA mode, in order to disable any pending or future DMA request. Then software may normally reconfigure both BDMA and the peripheral in DMA mode for a new transfer.

# **17.5 BDMA interrupts**

An interrupt can be generated on a half transfer, transfer complete or transfer error for each DMA channel x. Separate interrupt enable bits are available for flexibility.

### **17.6.2 BDMA interrupt flag clear register (BDMA\_IFCR)**

Address offset: 0x04

Reset value: 0x0000 0000

Setting the global clear bit CGIFx of the channel x in this BDMA\_IFCR register, causes the BDMA hardware to clear the corresponding GIFx bit and any individual flag among TEIFx, HTIFx, TCIFx, in the BDMA\_ISR register.

Setting any individual clear bit among CTEIFx, CHTIFx, CTCIFx in this BDMA\_IFCR register, causes the BDMA hardware to clear the corresponding individual flag and the global flag GIFx in the BDMA\_ISR register, provided that none of the two other individual flags is set.

Writing 0 into any flag clear bit has no effect.

Bits 15:0 **NDT[15:0]**: number of data to transfer (0 to 216 - 1)

This field is updated by hardware when the channel is enabled:

- It is decremented after each single BDMA 'read followed by write' transfer, indicating the remaining amount of data items to transfer.
- It is kept at zero when the programmed amount of data to transfer is reached, if the channel is not in circular mode (CIRC = 0 in the BDMA\_CCRx register).
- It is reloaded automatically by the previously programmed value, when the transfer is complete, if the channel is in circular mode (CIRC = 1).

If this field is zero, no transfer can be served whatever the channel status (enabled or not).

*Note: this field is set and cleared by software.*
