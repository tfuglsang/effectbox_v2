# **10 Clock recovery system (CRS)**

## **10.1 Introduction**

The clock recovery system (CRS) is an advanced digital controller acting on the internal fine-granularity trimmable RC oscillator HSI48. The CRS provides powerful means to evaluate the oscillator output frequency, based on comparison with a selectable synchronization signal. The CRS is capable of automatic trimming adjustments based on the measured frequency error value, while keeping the possibility of a manual trimming.

The CRS is ideally suited to provide a precise clock to the USB peripheral. In this case, the synchronization signal can be derived from the start-of-frame (SOF) packet signalization on the USB bus, sent by a USB host at 1 ms intervals.

The synchronization signal can also be derived from the LSE oscillator output, or generated by user software.

**Table 90. CRS internal input/output signals (continued)**

### **10.5.1 Synchronization input**

The CRS synchronization (SYNC) source, selectable through the CRS\_CFGR register, can be the signal from an external signal (SYNC), the LSE clock, the OTG HS1 SOF signal, or the OTG HS2 SOF signal. This source signal also has a configurable polarity and can then be divided by a programmable binary prescaler to obtain a synchronization signal in a suitable frequency range (usually around 1 kHz).

For more information on the CRS synchronization source configuration, refer to *[Section 10.8.2](#page-7-0)*.

It is also possible to generate a synchronization event by software, by setting the SWSYNC bit in the CRS\_CR register.

### <span id="page-2-0"></span>**10.5.2 Frequency error measurement**

The frequency error counter is a 16-bit down/up counter, reloaded with the RELOAD value on each SYNC event. It starts counting down until it reaches the 0 value, where the ESYNC (expected synchronization) event is generated. Then it starts counting up to the OUTRANGE limit, where it eventually stops (if no SYNC event is received), and generates a SYNCMISS event. The OUTRANGE limit is defined as the frequency error limit (FELIM field of the CRS\_CFGR register) multiplied by 128.

When the SYNC event is detected, the actual value of the frequency error counter and its counting direction are stored in the FECAP (frequency error capture) field and in the FEDIR (frequency error direction) bit of the CRS\_ISR register. When the SYNC event is detected during the down-counting phase (before reaching the 0 value), it means that the actual frequency is lower than the target (the TRIM value must be incremented). When it is detected during the up-counting phase, it means that the actual frequency is higher (the TRIM value must be decremented).

**Figure 72. CRS counter behavior**

### <span id="page-3-0"></span>**10.5.3 Frequency error evaluation and automatic trimming**

The measured frequency error is evaluated by comparing its value with a set of limits:

- TOLERANCE LIMIT, given directly in the FELIM field of the CRS\_CFGR register
- WARNING LIMIT, defined as 3 × FELIM value
- OUTRANGE (error limit), defined as 128 × FELIM value

The result of this comparison is used to generate the status indication and also to control the automatic trimming which is enabled by setting the AUTOTRIMEN bit in the CRS\_CR register:

- When the frequency error is below the tolerance limit, it means that the actual trimming value in the TRIM field is the optimal one, hence no trimming action is needed.
  - SYNCOK status indicated
  - TRIM value not changed in AUTOTRIM mode
- When the frequency error is below the warning limit but above or equal to the tolerance limit, it means that some trimming action is necessary but that adjustment by one trimming step is enough to reach the optimal TRIM value.
  - SYNCOK status indicated
  - TRIM value adjusted by one trimming step in AUTOTRIM mode

- When the frequency error is above or equal to the warning limit but below the error limit, a stronger trimming action is necessary, and there is a risk that the optimal TRIM value is not reached for the next period.
  - SYNCWARN status indicated
  - TRIM value adjusted by two trimming steps in AUTOTRIM mode
- When the frequency error is above or equal to the error limit, the frequency is out of the trimming range. This can also happen when the SYNC input is not clean, or when some SYNC pulse is missing (for example when one USB SOF is corrupted).
  - SYNCERR or SYNCMISS status indicated
  - TRIM value not changed in AUTOTRIM mode

*Note: If the actual value of the TRIM field is close to its limits and the automatic trimming can force it to overflow or underflow, the TRIM value is set to the limit, and the TRIMOVF status is indicated.*

> *In AUTOTRIM mode (AUTOTRIMEN bit set in the CRS\_CR register) the TRIM field of CRS\_CR is adjusted by hardware and is read-only.*

### **10.5.4 CRS initialization and configuration**

### **RELOAD value**

The RELOAD value must be selected according to the ratio between the target frequency and the frequency of the synchronization source after prescaling. This value is decreased by 1, to reach the expected synchronization on the 0 value. The formula is the following:

RELOAD = (fTARGET / fSYNC) - 1

The reset value of the RELOAD field corresponds to a target frequency of 48 MHz and a synchronization signal frequency of 1 kHz (SOF signal from USB).

### **FELIM value**

The selection of the FELIM value is closely coupled with the HSI48 oscillator characteristics and its typical trimming step size. The optimal value corresponds to half of the trimming step size, expressed as a number of oscillator clock ticks. The following formula can be used:

FELIM = (fTARGET / fSYNC) \* STEP[%] / 100% / 2

The result must be always rounded up to the nearest integer value to obtain the best trimming response. If frequent trimming actions are not needed in the application, the hysteresis can be increased by slightly increasing the FELIM value.

The reset value of the FELIM field corresponds to (fTARGET / fSYNC) = 48000, and to a typical trimming step size of 0.14%.

*Note: The trimming step size depends upon the product, check the datasheet for accurate setting.*

**Caution:** There is no hardware protection from a wrong configuration of the RELOAD and FELIM fields, this can lead to an erratic trimming response. The expected operational mode requires proper setup of the RELOAD value (according to the synchronization source frequency), which is also greater than 128 \* FELIM value (OUTRANGE limit).

#### Bit 31 **SYNCPOL**: SYNC polarity selection

This bit is set and cleared by software to select the input polarity for the SYNC signal source.

- 0: SYNC active on rising edge (default)
- 1: SYNC active on falling edge
- Bit 30 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

### Bits 29:28 **SYNCSRC[1:0]**: SYNC signal source selection

These bits are set and cleared by software to select the SYNC signal source.

- 00: CRS\_SYNC pin selected as SYNC signal source
- 01: LSE selected as SYNC signal source

- 11: OTG HS2 SOF selected as SYNC signal source

*Note: When using USB LPM (Link Power Management) and the device is in Sleep mode, the periodic USB SOF will not be generated by the host. No SYNC signal will therefore be provided to the CRS to calibrate the HSI48 oscillator on the run. To guarantee the required clock precision after waking up from Sleep mode, the LSE clock or the SYNC pin must be used as SYNC signal.*

#### Bits 31:16 FECAP[15:0]: Frequency error capture

FECAP is the frequency error counter value latched in the time of the last SYNC event. Refer to *Section 10.5.3* for more details about FECAP usage.

#### Bit 15 **FEDIR**: Frequency error direction

FEDIR is the counting direction of the frequency error counter latched in the time of the last SYNC event. It shows whether the actual frequency is below or above the target.

- 0: Up-counting direction, the actual frequency is above the target
- 1: Down-counting direction, the actual frequency is below the target

#### Bits 14:11 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

### Bit 10 **TRIMOVF**: Trimming overflow or underflow

This flag is set by hardware when the automatic trimming tries to over- or under-flow the TRIM value. An interrupt is generated if the ERRIE bit is set in the CRS\_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the ERRC bit in the CRS\_ICR register.

- 0: No trimming error signaled
- 1: Trimming error signaled

550/3556 RM0399 Rev 4

#### Bit 9 **SYNCMISS**: SYNC missed

This flag is set by hardware when the frequency error counter reaches value FELIM \* 128 and no SYNC is detected, meaning either that a SYNC pulse was missed, or the frequency error is too big (internal frequency too high) to be compensated by adjusting the TRIM value, hence some other action must be taken. At this point, the frequency error counter is stopped (waiting for a next SYNC), and an interrupt is generated if the ERRIE bit is set in the CRS\_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the ERRC bit in the CRS\_ICR register.

0: No SYNC missed error signaled

1: SYNC missed error signaled

#### Bit 8 **SYNCERR**: SYNC error

This flag is set by hardware when the SYNC pulse arrives before the ESYNC event and the measured frequency error is greater than or equal to FELIM \* 128. This means that the frequency error is too big (internal frequency too low) to be compensated by adjusting the TRIM value, and that some other action has to be taken. An interrupt is generated if the ERRIE bit is set in the CRS\_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the ERRC bit in the CRS\_ICR register.

0: No SYNC error signaled

1: SYNC error signaled

#### Bits 7:4 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

#### Bit 3 **ESYNCF**: Expected SYNC flag

This flag is set by hardware when the frequency error counter reached a zero value. An interrupt is generated if the ESYNCIE bit is set in the CRS\_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the ESYNCC bit in the CRS\_ICR register.

0: No expected SYNC signaled

1: Expected SYNC signaled

#### Bit 2 **ERRF**: Error flag

This flag is set by hardware in case of any synchronization or trimming error. It is the logical OR of the TRIMOVF, SYNCMISS and SYNCERR bits. An interrupt is generated if the ERRIE bit is set in the CRS\_CR register. It is cleared by software in reaction to setting the ERRC bit in the CRS\_ICR register, which clears the TRIMOVF, SYNCMISS and SYNCERR bits.

0: No synchronization or trimming error signaled

1: Synchronization or trimming error signaled

#### Bit 1 **SYNCWARNF**: SYNC warning flag

This flag is set by hardware when the measured frequency error is greater than or equal to FELIM \* 3, but smaller than FELIM \* 128. This means that to compensate the frequency error, the TRIM value must be adjusted by two steps or more. An interrupt is generated if the SYNCWARNIE bit is set in the CRS\_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the SYNCWARNC bit in the CRS\_ICR register.

0: No SYNC warning signaled

1: SYNC warning signaled

#### Bit 0 **SYNCOKF**: SYNC event OK flag

This flag is set by hardware when the measured frequency error is smaller than FELIM \* 3. This means that either no adjustment of the TRIM value is needed or that an adjustment by one trimming step is enough to compensate the frequency error. An interrupt is generated if the SYNCOKIE bit is set in the CRS\_CR register. It is cleared by software by setting the SYNCOKC bit in the CRS\_ICR register.

Bit 3 ESYNCC: Expected SYNC clear flag

Writing 1 to this bit clears the ESYNCF flag in the CRS ISR register.

Bit 2 ERRC: Error clear flag

Writing 1 to this bit clears TRIMOVF, SYNCMISS and SYNCERR bits and consequently also the ERRF flag in the CRS\_ISR register.

Bit 1 **SYNCWARNC**: SYNC warning clear flag

Writing 1 to this bit clears the SYNCWARNF flag in the CRS\_ISR register.

Bit 0 SYNCOKC: SYNC event OK clear flag

Writing 1 to this bit clears the SYNCOKF flag in the CRS\_ISR register.
