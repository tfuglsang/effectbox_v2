# **22 Cyclic redundancy check calculation unit (CRC)**

## **22.1 Introduction**

The CRC (cyclic redundancy check) calculation unit is used to get a CRC code from 8-, 16 or 32-bit data word and a generator polynomial.

Among other applications, CRC-based techniques are used to verify data transmission or storage integrity. In the scope of the functional safety standards, they offer a means of verifying the flash memory integrity. The CRC calculation unit helps compute a signature of the software during runtime, to be compared with a reference signature generated at link time and stored at a given memory location.

## **22.2 CRC main features**

- Uses CRC-32 (Ethernet) polynomial: 0x4C11DB7 X32 + X26 + X23 + X22 + X16 + X12 + X11 + X10 +X8 + X7 + X5 + X4 + X2+ X +1
- Alternatively, uses fully programmable polynomial with programmable size (7, 8, 16, 32 bits)
- Handles 8-,16-, 32-bit data size
- Programmable CRC initial value
- Single input/output 32-bit data register
- Input buffer to avoid bus stall during calculation
- CRC computation done in 4 AHB clock cycles (HCLK) for the 32-bit data size
- General-purpose 8-bit register (can be used for temporary storage)
- Reversibility option on I/O data
- Accessed through AHB slave peripheral by 32-bit words only, with the exception of CRC\_DR register that can be accessed by words, right-aligned half-words and rightaligned bytes

#### **22.3.3 CRC operation**

The CRC calculation unit has a single 32-bit read/write data register (CRC\_DR). It is used to input new data (write access), and holds the result of the previous CRC calculation (read access).

Each write operation to the data register creates a combination of the previous CRC value (stored in CRC\_DR) and the new one. CRC computation is done on the whole 32-bit data word or byte by byte depending on the format of the data being written.

The CRC\_DR register can be accessed by word, right-aligned half-word and right-aligned byte. For the other registers only 32-bit accesses are allowed.

The duration of the computation depends on data width:

- 4 AHB clock cycles for 32 bits
- 2 AHB clock cycles for 16 bits
- 1 AHB clock cycles for 8 bits

An input buffer allows a second data to be immediately written without waiting for any wait states due to the previous CRC calculation.

The data size can be dynamically adjusted to minimize the number of write accesses for a given number of bytes. For instance, a CRC for 5 bytes can be computed with a word write followed by a byte write.

The input data can be reversed to manage the various endianness schemes. The reversing operation can be performed on 8 bits, 16 bits and 32 bits depending on the REV\_IN[1:0] bits in the CRC\_CR register.

For example, 0x1A2B3C4D input data are used for CRC calculation as:

- 0x58D43CB2 with bit-reversal done by byte
- 0xD458B23C with bit-reversal done by half-word
- 0xB23CD458 with bit-reversal done on the full word

The output data can also be reversed by setting the REV\_OUT bit in the CRC\_CR register.

The operation is done at bit level. For example, 0x11223344 output data are converted to 0x22CC4488.

 The CRC calculator can be initialized to a programmable value using the RESET control bit in the CRC\_CR register (the default value is 0xFFFFFFFF).

The initial CRC value can be programmed with the CRC\_INIT register. The CRC\_DR register is automatically initialized upon CRC\_INIT register write access.

The CRC\_IDR register can be used to hold a temporary value related to CRC calculation. It is not affected by the RESET bit in the CRC\_CR register.

#### **Polynomial programmability**

The polynomial coefficients are fully programmable through the CRC\_POL register, and the polynomial size can be configured to be 7, 8, 16 or 32 bits by programming the POLYSIZE[1:0] bits in the CRC\_CR register. Even polynomials are not supported.

*Note: The type of an even polynomial is X+X2+..+Xn, while the type of an odd polynomial is 1+X+X2+..+Xn.*

> If the CRC data is less than 32-bit, its value can be read from the least significant bits of the CRC\_DR register.

> To obtain a reliable CRC calculation, the change on-fly of the polynomial value or size can not be performed during a CRC calculation. As a result, if a CRC calculation is ongoing, the application must either reset it or perform a CRC\_DR read before changing the polynomial.

The default polynomial value is the CRC-32 (Ethernet) polynomial: 0x4C11DB7.

## **22.4 CRC registers**

The CRC\_DR register can be accessed by words, right-aligned half-words and right-aligned bytes. For the other registers only 32-bit accesses are allowed.
