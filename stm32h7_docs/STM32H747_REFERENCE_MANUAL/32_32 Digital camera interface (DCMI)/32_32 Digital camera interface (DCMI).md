# **32 Digital camera interface (DCMI)**

# **32.1 Introduction**

The digital camera is a synchronous parallel interface able to receive a high-speed data flow from an external 8-, 10-, 12- or 14-bit CMOS camera module. It supports different data formats: YCbCr4:2:2/RGB565 progressive video and compressed data (JPEG).

# **32.2 DCMI main features**

- 8-, 10-, 12- or 14-bit parallel interface
- Embedded/external line and frame synchronization
- Continuous or snapshot mode
- Crop feature
- Supports the following data formats:
  - 8/10/12/14-bit progressive video: either monochrome or raw Bayer
  - YCbCr 4:2:2 progressive video
  - RGB 565 progressive video
  - Compressed data: JPEG

# **32.3 DCMI functional description**

The digital camera interface is a synchronous parallel interface that can receive high-speed data flows. It consists of up to 14 data lines (DCMI\_D[13:0]) and a pixel clock line (DCMI\_PIXCLK). The pixel clock has a programmable polarity, so that data can be captured on either the rising or the falling edge of the pixel clock.

The data are packed into a 32-bit data register (DCMI\_DR) and then transferred through a general-purpose DMA channel. The image buffer is managed by the DMA, not by the camera interface.

The data received from the camera can be organized in lines/frames (raw YUB/RGB/Bayer modes) or can be a sequence of JPEG images. To enable JPEG image reception, the JPEG bit (bit 3 of DCMI\_CR register) must be set.

The data flow is synchronized either by hardware using the optional DCMI\_HSYNC (horizontal synchronization) and DCMI\_VSYNC (vertical synchronization) signals or by synchronization codes embedded in the data flow.

| DCMI_VSYNC |              | Input       | Vertical synchronization                |  |

The following table shows DCMI internal signals.

**Table 261. DCMI internal input/output signals** 

| Internal signal<br>Signal type<br>name |        | Description            |
|----------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|
| dcmi_dma                               | Output | DCMI DMA request       |
| dcmi_it                                | Output | DCMI interrupt request |
| dcmi_hclk                              | Input  | DCMI interface clock   |

## **32.3.3 DCMI clocks**

The digital camera interface uses two clock domains, DCMI\_PIXCLK and HCLK. The signals generated with DCMI\_PIXCLK are sampled on the rising edge of HCLK once they are stable. An enable signal is generated in the HCLK domain, to indicate that data coming from the camera are stable and can be sampled. The maximum DCMI\_PIXCLK period must be higher than 2.5 HCLK periods.

## **32.3.4 DCMI DMA interface**

The DMA interface is active when the CAPTURE bit of the DCMI\_CR register is set. A DMA request is generated each time the camera interface receives a complete 32-bit data block in its register.

## **32.3.5 DCMI physical interface**

The interface is composed of 11/13/15/17 inputs. Only the Slave mode is supported.

The camera interface can capture 8-bit, 10-bit, 12-bit or 14-bit data depending on the EDM[1:0] bits of the DCMI\_CR register. If less than 14 bits are used, the unused input pins must be connected to ground.

DCMI pins are shown in *[Table 260](#page-1-1)*.

The data are synchronous with DCMI\_PIXCLK and change on the rising/falling edge of the pixel clock depending on the polarity.

The DCMI\_HSYNC signal indicates the start/end of a line.

The DCMI\_VSYNC signal indicates the start/end of a frame

**Figure 243. DCMI signal waveforms**

- 1. The capture edge of DCMI\_PIXCLK is the falling edge, the active state of DCMI\_HSYNC and DCMI\_VSYNC is 1.
- 2. DCMI\_HSYNC and DCMI\_VSYNC can change states at the same time.

### **8-bit data**

When EDM[1:0] = 00 in DCMI\_CR the interface captures 8 LSBs at its input (DCMI\_D[7:0]) and stores them as 8-bit data. The DCMI\_D[13:8] inputs are ignored. In this case, to capture a 32-bit word, the camera interface takes four pixel clock cycles.

The first captured data byte is placed in the LSB position in the 32-bit word and the 4th captured data byte is placed in the MSB position in the 32-bit word. The table below gives an example of the positioning of captured data bytes in two 32-bit words.

![](_page_2_Picture_21.jpeg)

**Table 262. Positioning of captured data bytes in 32-bit words (8-bit width)** 

## **10-bit data**

When EDM[1:0] = 01 in DCMI\_CR, the camera interface captures 10-bit data at its input DCMI\_D[9:0] and stores them as the 10 least significant bits of a 16-bit word. The remaining most significant bits of the DCMI\_DR register (bits 11 to 15) are cleared to zero. So, in this case, a 32-bit data word is made up every two pixel clock cycles.

The first captured data are placed in the LSB position in the 32-bit word and the 2nd captured data are placed in the MSB position in the 32-bit word as shown in the table below.

**Table 263. Positioning of captured data bytes in 32-bit words (10-bit width)** 

| Byte address | 31:26 | 25:16     | 15:10 | 9:0       |
|--------------|-------|-----------|-------|-----------|

| 4            | 0     | Dn+3[9:0] | 0     | Dn+2[9:0] |

### **12-bit data**

When EDM[1:0] = 10 in DCMI\_CR, the camera interface captures the 12-bit data at its input DCMI\_D[11:0] and stores them as the 12 least significant bits of a 16-bit word. The remaining most significant bits are cleared to zero. So, in this case a 32-bit data word is made up every two pixel clock cycles.

The first captured data are placed in the LSB position in the 32-bit word and the 2nd captured data are placed in the MSB position in the 32-bit word as shown in the table below.

**Table 264. Positioning of captured data bytes in 32-bit words (12-bit width)** 

| Byte address | 31:28 | 27:16      | 15:12 | 11:0       |
|--------------|-------|------------|-------|------------|
| 0            | 0     | Dn+1[11:0] | 0     | Dn[11:0]   |
| 4            | 0     | Dn+3[11:0] | 0     | Dn+2[11:0] |

### **14-bit data**

When EDM[1:0] = 11 in DCMI\_CR, the camera interface captures the 14-bit data at its input DCMI\_D[13:0] and stores them as the 14 least significant bits of a 16-bit word. The remaining most significant bits are cleared to zero. So, in this case a 32-bit data word is made up every two pixel clock cycles.

The first captured data are placed in the LSB position in the 32-bit word and the 2nd captured data are placed in the MSB position in the 32-bit word as shown in the table below.

## **32.3.6 DCMI synchronization**

The digital camera interface supports embedded or hardware (DCMI\_HSYNC and DCMI\_VSYNC) synchronization. When embedded synchronization is used, it is up to the digital camera module to make sure that the 0x00 and 0xFF values are used ONLY for synchronization (not in data). Embedded synchronization codes are supported only for the 8-bit parallel data interface width (that is, in the DCMI\_CR register, the EDM[1:0] bits must be cleared).

For compressed data, the DCMI supports only the hardware synchronization mode. In this case, DCMI\_VSYNC is used as a start/end of the image, and DCMI\_HSYNC is used as a Data Valid signal. *[Figure 244](#page-4-0)* shows the corresponding timing diagram.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>ai15944b Beginning of JPEG stream JPEG data DCMI\_HSYNC JPEG packet data DCMI\_VSYNC Padding data at the end of the JPEG stream Programmable JPEG packet size End of JPEG stream Packet dispatching depends on the image content. This results in a variable blanking duration.

**Figure 244. Timing diagram**

### **Hardware synchronization mode**

In hardware synchronization mode, the two synchronization signals (DCMI\_HSYNC/DCMI\_VSYNC) are used.

Depending on the camera module/mode, data may be transmitted during horizontal/vertical synchronization periods. The DCMI\_HSYNC/DCMI\_VSYNC signals act like blanking signals since all the data received during DCMI\_HSYNC/DCMI\_VSYNC active periods are ignored.

In order to correctly transfer images into the DMA/RAM buffer, data transfer is synchronized with the DCMI\_VSYNC signal. When the hardware synchronization mode is selected, and

![](_page_4_Picture_14.jpeg)

capture is enabled (CAPTURE bit set in DCMI\_CR), data transfer is synchronized with the deactivation of the DCMI\_VSYNC signal (next start of frame).

Transfer can then be continuous, with successive frames transferred by DMA to successive buffers or the same/circular buffer. To allow the DMA management of successive frames, a VSIF (Vertical synchronization interrupt flag) is activated at the end of each frame.

## **Embedded data synchronization mode**

In this synchronization mode, the data flow is synchronized using 32-bit codes embedded in the data flow. These codes use the 0x00/0xFF values that are *not* used in data anymore. There are 4 types of codes, all with a 0xFF0000XY format. The embedded synchronization codes are supported only in 8-bit parallel data width capture (in the DCMI\_CR register, the EDM[1:0] bits must be cleared). For other data widths, this mode generates unpredictable results and must not be used.

*Note: Camera modules can have 8 such codes (in interleaved mode). For this reason, the interleaved mode is not supported by the camera interface (otherwise, every other half-frame would be discarded).*

• Mode 2

Four embedded codes signal the following events

- Frame start (FS)
- Frame end (FE)
- Line start (LS)
- Line end (LE)

The XY values in the 0xFF0000XY format of the four codes are programmable (see *[Section 32.5.7: DCMI embedded synchronization code register \(DCMI\\_ESCR\)](#page-18-0)*).

A 0xFF value programmed as a "frame end" means that all the unused codes are interpreted as valid frame end codes.

In this mode, once the camera interface has been enabled, the frame capture starts after the first occurrence of the frame end (FE) code followed by a frame start (FS) code.

• Mode 1

An alternative coding is the camera mode 1. This mode is ITU656 compatible.

The codes signal another set of events:

- SAV (active line) line start
- EAV (active line) line end
- SAV (blanking) end of line during interframe blanking period
- EAV (blanking) end of line during interframe blanking period

This mode can be supported by programming the following codes:

- FS ≤ 0xFF
- FE ≤ 0xFF
- LS ≤ SAV (active)
- LE ≤ EAV (active)

An embedded unmask code is also implemented for frame/line start and frame/line end codes. Using it, it is possible to compare only the selected unmasked bits with the programmed code. A bit can therefore be selected to compare in the embedded code and

![](_page_5_Picture_30.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 1215/3556

detect a frame/line start or frame/line end. This means that there can be different codes for the frame/line start and frame/line end with the unmasked bit position remaining the same.

### **Example**

FS = 0xA5

Unmask code for FS = 0x10

In this case the frame start code is embedded in the bit 4 of the frame start code.

## **32.3.7 DCMI capture modes**

This interface supports two types of capture: snapshot (single frame) and continuous grab.

### **Snapshot mode (single frame)**

In this mode, a single frame is captured (CM = 1 of the DCMI\_CR register). After the CAPTURE bit is set in DCMI\_CR, the interface waits for the detection of a start of frame before sampling the data. The camera interface is automatically disabled (CAPTURE bit cleared in DCMI\_CR) after receiving the first complete frame. An interrupt is generated (IT\_FRAME) if it is enabled.

In case of an overrun, the frame is lost and the CAPTURE bit is cleared.

![](_page_6_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Figure 245. Frame capture waveforms in snapshot mode**

- 1. Here, the active state of DCMI\_HSYNC and DCMI\_VSYNC is 1.
- 2. DCMI\_HSYNC and DCMI\_VSYNC can change states at the same time.

### **Continuous grab mode**

In this mode (CM bit = 0 in DCMI\_CR), once the CAPTURE bit has been set in DCMI\_CR, the grabbing process starts on the next DCMI\_VSYNC or embedded frame start depending on the mode. The process continues until the CAPTURE bit is cleared in DCMI\_CR. Once the CAPTURE bit has been cleared, the grabbing process continues until the end of the current frame.

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 246. Frame capture waveforms in continuous grab mode**

- 1. Here, the active state of DCMI\_HSYNC and DCMI\_VSYNC is 1.
- 2. DCMI\_HSYNC and DCMI\_VSYNC can change states at the same time.

In continuous grab mode, the FCRC[1:0] bits in DCMI\_CR can be configured to grab all pictures, every second picture or one out of four pictures to decrease the frame capture rate.

*Note: In the hardware synchronization mode (ESS = 0 in DCMI\_CR), the IT\_VSYNC interrupt is generated (if enabled) even when CAPTURE = 0 in DCMI\_CR so, to reduce the frame capture rate even further, the IT\_VSYNC interrupt can be used to count the number of frames between 2 captures in conjunction with the Snapshot mode. This is not allowed by embedded data synchronization mode.*

## **32.3.8 DCMI crop feature**

With the crop feature, the camera interface can select a rectangular window from the received image. The start (upper left corner) coordinates and size (horizontal dimension in number of pixel clocks and vertical dimension in number of lines) are specified using two 32-bit registers (DCMI\_CWSTRT and DCMI\_CWSIZE). The size of the window is specified in number of pixel clocks (horizontal dimension) and in number of lines (vertical dimension).

MS35933V3 CAPCNT[13:0] in DCMI\_CWSIZE HOFFCNT[13:0] in DCMI\_CWSTRT VST[12:0] in DCMI\_CWSTRT VLINE[13:0] in DCMI\_CWSIZE

**Figure 247. Coordinates and size of the window after cropping**

These registers specify the coordinates of the starting point of the capture window as a line number (in the frame, starting from 0) and a number of pixel clocks (on the line, starting from 0), and the size of the window as a line number and a number of pixel clocks. The CAPCNT value can only be a multiple of 4 (two least significant bits are forced to 0) to allow the correct transfer of data through the DMA.

![](_page_7_Picture_14.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 1217/3556

If the DCMI\_VSYNC signal goes active before the number of lines is specified in the DCMI\_CWSIZE register, then the capture stops and an IT\_FRAME interrupt is generated when enabled.

![](_page_8_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Figure 248. Data capture waveforms**

- 1. Here, the active state of DCMI\_HSYNC and DCMI\_VSYNC is 1.
- 2. DCMI\_HSYNC and DCMI\_VSYNC can change states at the same time.

## **32.3.9 DCMI JPEG format**

To allow JPEG image reception, it is necessary to set the JPEG bit of the DCMI\_CR register. JPEG images are not stored as lines and frames, so the DCMI\_VSYNC signal is used to start the capture while DCMI\_HSYNC serves as a data enable signal. The number of bytes in a line may not be a multiple of 4. This case must be carefully handled since a DMA request is generated each time a complete 32-bit word has been constructed from the captured data. When an end of frame is detected and the 32-bit word to be transferred has not been completely received, the remaining data are padded with zeros and a DMA request is generated.

The crop feature and embedded synchronization codes cannot be used in JPEG format.

## **32.3.10 DCMI FIFO**

A 8-word FIFO is implemented to manage data rate transfers on the AHB. The DCMI features a simple FIFO controller with a read pointer incremented each time the camera interface reads from the AHB, and a write pointer incremented each time the camera interface writes to the FIFO. There is no overrun protection to prevent the data from being overwritten if the AHB interface does not sustain the data transfer rate.

In case of overrun or errors in the synchronization signals, the FIFO is reset and the DCMI interface waits for a new start of frame.

## **32.3.11 DCMI data format description**

### **Data formats**

Three types of data are supported:

- 8/10/12/14-bit progressive video: either monochrome or raw Bayer format
- YCbCr 4:2:2 progressive video
- RGB565 progressive video. A pixel coded in 16 bits (5 bits for blue, 5 bits for red, 6 bits for green) takes two clock cycles to be transferred.

Compressed data: JPEG

For B&W (black and white), YCbCr or RGB data, the maximum input size is 2048 × 2048 pixels. No limit in JPEG compressed mode.

For monochrome, RGB and YCbCr, the frame buffer is stored in raster mode. 32-bit words are used. Only the little-endian format is supported.

![](_page_9_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Figure 249. Pixel raster scan order**

## **Monochrome format**

Characteristics:

- Raster format
- 8 bits per pixel

The table below shows how the data are stored.

**Table 266. Data storage in monochrome progressive video format** 

| Byte address | 31:24 | 23:16 | 15:8  | 7:0   |
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 0            | n + 3 | n + 2 | n + 1 | n     |
| 4            | n + 7 | n + 6 | n + 5 | n + 4 |

### **RGB format**

Characteristics:

- Raster format
- RGB
- Interleaved: one buffer: R, G and B interleaved (such as BRGBRGBRG)
- Optimized for display output

![](_page_9_Picture_26.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 1219/3556

The RGB planar format is compatible with standard OS frame buffer display formats.

Only 16 BPP (bits per pixel): RGB565 (2 pixels per 32-bit word) is supported.

The 24 BPP (palletized format) and gray-scale formats are not supported. Pixels are stored in a raster scan order, that is from top to bottom for pixel rows, and from left to right within a pixel row. Pixel components are R (red), G (green) and B (blue). All components have the same spatial resolution (4:4:4 format). A frame is stored in a single part, with the components interleaved on a pixel basis.

The table below shows how the data are stored.

**Table 267. Data storage in RGB progressive video format** 

| Byte address | 31:27     |             | 20:16      | 15:11     | 10:5        | 4:0        |  |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|--|
| 0            | Red n + 1 | Green n + 1 | Blue n + 1 | Red n     | Green n     | Blue n     |  |
| 4            | Red n + 4 | Green n + 3 | Blue n + 3 | Red n + 2 | Green n + 2 | Blue n + 2 |  |

### **YCbCr format**

Characteristics:

- Raster format
- YCbCr 4:2:2
- Interleaved: one buffer: Y, Cb and Cr interleaved (such as CbYCrYCbYCr)

Pixel components are Y (luminance or "luma"), Cb and Cr (chrominance or "chroma" blue and red). Each component is encoded in 8 bits. Luma and chroma are stored together (interleaved) as shown in the table below.

**Table 268. Data storage in YCbCr progressive video format** 

| Byte address | 31:24   |          | 15:8    | 7:0      |  |  |
|--------------|---------|----------|---------|----------|--|--|
| 0            | Y n + 1 | Cr n     | Y n     | Cb n     |  |  |
| 4            | Y n + 3 | Cr n + 2 | Y n + 2 | Cb n + 2 |  |  |

### **YCbCr format - Y only**

Characteristics:

- Raster format
- YCbCr 4:2:2
- The buffer only contains Y information monochrome image

Pixel components are Y (luminance or "luma"), Cb and Cr (chrominance or "chroma" blue and red). In this mode, the chroma information is dropped. Only the luma component of each pixel, encoded in 8 bits, is stored as shown in *[Table 269](#page-11-0)*.

The result is a monochrome image having the same resolution as the original YCbCr data.

| 4            | Y n + 7 | Y n + 6 | Y n + 5 | Y n + 4 |

### Half resolution image extraction

This is a modification of the previous reception modes, being applicable to monochrome, RGB or Y extraction modes.

This mode is used to only store a half resolution image. It is selected through OELS and LSM control bits.

# 32.4 DCMI interrupts

Five interrupts are generated. All interrupts are maskable by software. The global interrupt (dcmi\_it) is the OR of all the individual interrupts. The table below gives the list of all interrupts.

- 01: Every alternate frame captured (50% bandwidth reduction)
- 10: One frame out of four captured (75% bandwidth reduction)
- 11: reserved

#### Bit 7 **VSPOL:** Vertical synchronization polarity

This bit indicates the level on the DCMI\_VSYNC pin when the data are not valid on the parallel interface.

- 0: DCMI\_VSYNC active low
- 1: DCMI\_VSYNC active high

### Bit 6 **HSPOL:** Horizontal synchronization polarity

This bit indicates the level on the DCMI\_HSYNC pin when the data are not valid on the parallel interface.

RM0399 Rev 4 1223/3556

#### Bit 0 **CAPTURE:** Capture enable

0: Capture disabled

1: Capture enabled

The camera interface waits for the first start of frame, then a DMA request is generated to transfer the received data into the destination memory.

In snapshot mode, the CAPTURE bit is automatically cleared at the end of the first frame received.

In continuous grab mode, if the software clears this bit while a capture is ongoing, the bit is effectively cleared after the frame end.

*Note: The DMA controller and all DCMI configuration registers must be programmed correctly before enabling this bit.*
