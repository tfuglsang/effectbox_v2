# **4 Embedded flash memory (FLASH)**

# **4.1 Introduction**

The embedded flash memory (FLASH) manages the accesses of any master to the embedded non-volatile memory, that is 2 Mbytes. It implements the read, program and erase operations, error corrections as well as various integrity and confidentiality protection mechanisms.

The embedded flash memory manages the automatic loading of non-volatile user option bytes at power-on reset, and implements the dynamic update of these options.

# **4.2 FLASH main features**

- 2 Mbytes of non-volatile memory divided into two banks of 1 Mbyte each
- flash memory read operations supporting multiple length (64 bits, 32bits, 16bits or one byte)
- Flash memory programming by 256 bits
- 128-Kbyte sector erase, bank erase and dual-bank mass erase
- Dual-bank organization supporting:
  - simultaneous operations: two read/program/erase operations executed in parallel on both banks
  - Bank swapping: the address mapping of the user flash memory of each bank can be swapped, along with the corresponding registers.
- Error Code Correction (ECC): one error detection/correction or two error detections per 256-bit flash word using 10 ECC bits
- Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) hardware module
- User configurable non-volatile option bytes
- Flash memory enhanced protections, activated by option bytes
  - Read protection (RDP), preventing unauthorized flash memory dump to safeguard sensitive application code
  - Write-protection of sectors (WRPS), available per bank (128 Kbyte sectors)
  - Two proprietary code readout protection (PCROP) areas (one per user flash bank). When enabled, this area is execute-only.
  - Two secure-only areas (one per user flash bank). When enabled this area is accessible only if the STM32 microcontroller operates in Secure access mode.
- Read and write command queues to streamline flash operations

## <span id="page-2-1"></span>**4.3.3 FLASH architecture and integration in the system**

The embedded flash memory is a central resource for the whole microcontroller. It serves as an interface to two non-volatile memory banks, and organizes the memory in a very specific way. The embedded flash memory also proposes a set of security features to protect the assets stored in the non-volatile memory at boot time, at run-time and during firmware and configuration upgrades.

The embedded flash memory offers two 64-bit AXI slave ports for code and data accesses, plus a 32-bit AHB configuration slave port used for register bank accesses.

*Note: The application can simultaneously request a read and a write operation through each AXI interface.*

The embedded flash memory microarchitecture is shown in *[Figure 6](#page-3-0)*.

<span id="page-3-0"></span>![](_page_3_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Detailed FLASH architecture**

Behind the system interfaces, the embedded flash memory implements various command queues and buffers to perform flash read, write and erase operations with maximum efficiency.

Thanks to the addition of a read and write data buffer, the AXI slave port handles the following access types:

- Multiple length: 64 bits, 32 bits, 16 bits and 8 bits
- Single or burst accesses
- Write wrap burst must not cross 32-byte aligned address boundaries to target exactly one flash word

The AHB configuration slave port supports 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit word accesses.

The embedded flash memory is built in such a way that only one read or write operation can be executed at a time on a given bank.

# **4.3.4 Flash memory architecture and usage**

### **Flash memory architecture**

*[Figure 7](#page-4-0)* shows the non-volatile memory organization supported by the embedded flash memory.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 7. Embedded flash memory organization** 

The embedded flash non-volatile memory is composed of:

- A 2-Mbyte main memory block, organized as two banks of 1 Mbyte each. Each bank is in turn divided in eight 128-Kbyte sectors and features flash-word rows of 256 bits + 10 bits of ECC per word
- A system memory block of 256 Kbytes, divided into two 128 Kbyte banks. The system memory is ECC protected.
- A set of non-volatile option bytes loaded at reset by the embedded flash memory and accessible by the application software only through the AHB configuration register interface.

### Partition usage

*Figure 8* shows how the embedded flash memory is used both by STMicroelectronics and the application software.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>![](_page_7_Figure_4.jpeg)

Figure 8. Embedded flash memory usage

User and system memories are used differently according to whether the microcontroller is configured by the application software in Standard mode or in Secure access mode. This selection is done through the SECURITY option bit (see Section 4.4.6):

- In Standard mode, the user memory contains the application code and data, while the system memory is loaded with the STM32 bootloader. When a reset occurs, the executing core jumps to the boot address configured through the BOOT pin and the BOOT CMx ADD0/1 option bytes.
- In Secure access mode, dedicated libraries can be used for secure boot. They are located in user flash and system flash memory:
  - ST libraries in system flash memory assist the application software boot with special features such as secure boot and secure firmware install (SFI).
  - Application secure libraries in user flash memory are used for secure firmware update (SFU).

In Secure access mode, the microcontroller always boots into the secure bootloader code (unique entry point). Then, if no secure services are required, this code securely jumps to the requested boot address configured through the BOOT pin and the option bytes, as shown in *[Figure 8](#page-7-0)* (see *Section 5: Secure memory management (SMM)* for details).

*Note: For more information on option byte setup for boot, refer to [Section](#page-34-0) 4.4.7.*

Additional partition usage is the following:

• The option bytes are used by STMicroelectronics and by the application software as non-volatile product options (e.g. boot address, protection configuration and reset behaviors).

*Note: For further information on STM32 bootloader flashing by STMicroelectronics, refer to application note AN2606 "STM32 microcontroller system memory boot mode" available from www.st.com.*

### **Bank swapping**

As shown in *[Figure 8](#page-7-0)*, the embedded flash memory offers a bank swapping feature that can be configured through the SWAP\_BANK bit, always available for the application. For more information please refer to *[Section 4.3.13](#page-22-0)*.

## **4.3.5 FLASH system performance enhancements**

The embedded flash memory uses read and write command queues (one per bank) in order to enhance flash operations.

# **4.3.6 FLASH data protection schemes**

*[Figure 9](#page-8-0)* gives an overview of the protection mechanisms supported by the embedded flash memory. A PCROP and a secure-only area can be defined for each bank. The properties of these protected areas are detailed in *[Section 4.5](#page-34-1)*.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>![](_page_8_Figure_13.jpeg)

**Figure 9. FLASH protection mechanisms**

# **4.3.7 Overview of FLASH operations**

### **Read operations**

The embedded flash memory can perform read operations on the whole non-volatile memory using various granularities: 64 bits, 32 bits, 16 bits or one byte. User and system flash memories are read through the AXI interface, while the option bytes are read through the register interface.

The embedded flash memory supports read-while-write operations provided the read and write operations target different banks. Similarly read-while-read operations are supported when two read operations target different banks.

To increase efficiency, the embedded flash memory implements the buffering of consecutive read requests in the same bank.

For more details on read operations, refer to *[Section 4.3.8: FLASH read operations](#page-10-0)*.

### **Program/erase operations**

The embedded flash memory supports the following program and erase operations:

- Single flash word write (256-bit granularity), with the possibility for the application to force-write a user flash word with less than 256 bits
- Single sector erase
- Bank erase (single or dual)
- Option byte update

Thanks to its dual bank architecture, the embedded flash memory can perform any of the above write or erase operation on one bank while a read or another program/erase operation is executed on the other bank.

*Note: Program and erase operations are subject to the various protection that could be set on the embedded flash memory, such as write protection and global readout protection (see next sections for details).*

> To increase efficiency, the embedded flash memory implements the buffering of consecutive write accesses in the same bank.

For more details refer to *[Section 4.3.9: FLASH program operations](#page-13-0)* and *[Section 4.3.10:](#page-17-0)  [FLASH erase operations](#page-17-0).*

### **Protection mechanisms**

The embedded flash memory supports different protection mechanisms:

- Global readout protection (RDP)
- Proprietary code readout protection (PCROP)
- Write protection
- Secure access only protection

For more details refer to *[Section 4.5: FLASH protection mechanisms.](#page-34-1)*

![](_page_9_Picture_26.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 163/3556

### **Option byte loading**

Under specific conditions, the embedded flash memory reliably loads the non-volatile option bytes stored in non-volatile memory, thus enforcing boot and security options to the whole system when the embedded flash memory becomes functional again. For more details refer to *[Section 4.4: FLASH option bytes.](#page-25-0)*

### **Bank/register swapping**

The embedded flash memory allows swapping bank 1 and bank 2 memory mapping. This feature can be used after a firmware upgrade to restart the microcontroller on the new firmware after a system reset. For more details on the feature, refer to *[Section 4.3.13: Flash](#page-22-0)  [bank and register swapping](#page-22-0).*

## <span id="page-10-0"></span>**4.3.8 FLASH read operations**

### **Read operation overview**

The embedded flash memory supports, for each memory bank, the execution of one read command while two are waiting in the read command queue. Multiple read access types are also supported as defined in *[Section 4.3.3: FLASH architecture and integration in the](#page-2-1)  [system](#page-2-1)*.

The read commands to each bank are associated with a 256-bit read data buffer.

*Note: The embedded flash memory can perform single error correction and double error detection while read operations are being executed (see Section [4.3.12: Flash memory error](#page-20-0)  [protections\)](#page-20-0).* 

The AXI interface read channel operates as follows:

- When the read command queue is full, any new AXI read request stalls the bus read channel interface and consequently the master that issued that request.
- If several consecutive read accesses request data that belong to the same flash data word (256 bits), the data are read directly from the current data read buffer, without triggering additional flash read operations. This mechanism occurs each time a read access is granted. When a read access is rejected for security reasons (e.g. PCROP protected word), the corresponding read error response is issued by the embedded flash memory and no read operation to flash memory is triggered.

The Read pipeline architecture is summarized in *[Figure 10](#page-11-0)*.

For more information on bus interfaces, refer to *[Section 4.3.3: FLASH architecture and](#page-2-1)  [integration in the system](#page-2-1)*.

<span id="page-11-0"></span>![](_page_11_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 10. FLASH read pipeline architecture**

# **Single read sequence**

The recommended simple read sequence is the following:

- 1. Freely perform read accesses to any AXI-mapped area.
- 2. The embedded flash memory effectively executes the read operation from the read command queue buffer as soon as the non-volatile memory is ready and the previously requested operations on this specific bank have been served.

### **Adjusting read timing constraints**

The embedded flash memory clock must be enabled and running before reading data from non-volatile memory.

To correctly read data from flash memory, the number of wait states (LATENCY) must be correctly programmed in the flash access control register (FLASH\_ACR) according to the embedded flash memory AXI interface clock frequency (sys\_ck) and the internal voltage range of the device (Vcore).

*[Table 16](#page-12-0)* shows the correspondence between the number of wait states (LATENCY), the programming delay parameter (WRHIGHFREQ), the embedded flash memory clock frequency and its supply voltage ranges.

**Table 16. FLASH recommended number of wait states and programming delay(1)**

### **Adjusting system frequency**

After power-on, a default 7 wait-state latency is specified in FLASH\_ACR register, in order to accommodate AXI interface clock frequencies with a safety margin (see *[Table 16](#page-12-0)*).

When changing the AXI bus frequency, the application software must follow the below sequence in order to tune the number of wait states required to access the non-volatile memory.

To increase the embedded flash memory clock source frequency:

- 1. If necessary, program the LATENCY and WRHIGHFREQ bits to the right value in the FLASH\_ACR register, as described in *[Table](#page-12-0) 16*.
- 2. Check that the new number of wait states is taken into account by reading back the FLASH\_ACR register.
- 3. Modify the embedded flash memory clock source and/or the AXI bus clock prescaler in the RCC\_CFGR register of the reset and clock controller (RCC).
- 4. Check that the new embedded flash memory clock source and/or the new AXI bus clock prescaler value are taken in account by reading back the embedded flash memory clock source status and/or the AXI bus prescaler value in the RCC\_CFGR register of the reset and clock controller (RCC).

To decrease the embedded flash memory clock source frequency:

- 1. Modify the embedded flash memory clock source and/or the AXI bus clock prescaler in the RCC\_CFGR register of reset and clock controller (RCC).
- 2. Check that the embedded flash memory new clock source and/or the new AXI bus clock prescaler value are taken into account by reading back the embedded flash

<sup>1.</sup> Refer to the Reset and clock control section RCC section for the maximum product FACLK frequency.

- memory clock source status and/or the AXI interface prescaler value in the RCC\_CFGR register of reset and clock controller (RCC).
- 3. If necessary, program the LATENCY and WRHIGHFREQ bits to the right value in FLASH\_ACR register, as described in *[Table](#page-12-0) 16*.
- 4. Check that the new number of wait states has been taken into account by reading back the FLASH\_ACR register.

### **Error code correction (ECC)**

The embedded flash memory embeds an error correction mechanism. Single error correction and double error detection are performed for each read operation. For more details, refer to *[Section 4.3.12: Flash memory error protections](#page-20-0)*.

### **Read errors**

When the ECC mechanism is not able to correct the read operation, the embedded flash memory reports read errors as described in *[Section 4.7.7: Error correction code error](#page-49-0)  [\(SNECCERR/DBECCERR\)](#page-49-0)*.

### **Read interrupts**

See *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details.

# <span id="page-13-0"></span>**4.3.9 FLASH program operations**

# **Program operation overview**

The virgin state of each non-volatile memory bitcell is 1. The embedded flash memory supports programming operations that can change (reset) any memory bitcell to 0. However these operations do not support the return of a bit to its virgin state. In this case an erase operation of the entire sector is required.

A program operation consists in issuing write commands. The embedded flash memory supports, for each memory bank, the execution of one write command while one command is waiting in the write command queue. Since a 10-bit ECC code is associated to each 256 bit data flash word, only write operations by 256 bits are executed in the non-volatile memory.

*Note: The application can decide to write as little as 8 bits to a* 256 *flash word. In this case, a force-write mechanism to the* 256 *bits + ECC is used (see FW1/2 bit of FLASH\_CR1/2 register).*

> *System flash memory bank 1 cannot be written by the application software. System flash memory bank 2 can be written by STMicroelectronics secure firmware only.*

It is not recommended to overwrite a flash word that is not virgin. The result may lead to an inconsistent ECC code that will be systematically reported by the embedded flash memory, as described in *[Section 4.7.7: Error correction code error \(SNECCERR/DBECCERR\)](#page-49-0)*.

The AXI interface write channel operates as follows:

- A 256-bit write data buffer is associated with each AXI interface. It supports multiple write access types (64 bits, 32 bits, 16 bits and 8 bits).
- When the write queue is full, any new AXI write request stalls the bus write channel interface and consequently the master that issued that request.

The write pipeline architecture is described in *[Figure 11](#page-14-0)*.

![](_page_13_Picture_23.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 167/3556

For more information on bus interfaces, refer to Section 4.3.3; FLASH architecture and integration in the system.

<span id="page-14-0"></span>![](_page_14_Figure_3.jpeg)

Figure 11. FLASH write pipeline architecture

### Managing write protections

Before programming a user sector, the application software must check the protection of the targeted flash memory area.

The embedded flash memory checks the protection properties of the write transaction target at the output of the write queue buffer, just before the effective write operation to the nonvolatile memory:

- If a write protection violation is detected, the write operation is canceled and write protection error (WRPERR1/2) is raised in FLASH SR1/2 register.
- If the write operation is valid, the 10-bit ECC code is concatenated to the 256 bits of data and the write to non-volatile memory is effectively executed.

Note: No write protection check is performed when the embedded flash memory accepts AXI write requests.

> The write protection flag does not need to be cleared before performing a new programming operation.

![](_page_14_Picture_13.jpeg)

### **Monitoring ongoing write operations**

The application software can use three status flags located in FLASH\_SR1/2 in order to monitor ongoing write operations. Those status are available for each bank.

- **BSY1/2**: this bit indicates that an effective write, erase or option byte change operation is ongoing to the non-volatile memory.
- **QW1/2**: this bit indicates that a write, erase or option byte change operation is pending in the write queue or command queue buffer. It remains high until the write operation is complete. It supersedes the BSY1/2 status bit.
- **WBNE1/2**: this bit indicates that the embedded flash memory is waiting for new data to complete the 256-bit write buffer. In this state the write buffer is not empty. It is reset as soon as the application software fills the write buffer, force-writes the operation using FW1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2, or disables all write operations in the corresponding bank.

## **Enabling write operations**

Before programming the user flash memory in bank 1 (respectively bank 2), the application software must make sure that PG1 bit (respectively PG2) is set to 1 in FLASH\_CR1 (respectively FLASH\_CR2). If it is not the case, an unlock sequence must be used (see *[Section 4.5.1: FLASH configuration protection](#page-34-2)*) and the PG1/2 bit must be set.

When the option bytes need to be modified or a mass erase needs to be started, the application software must make sure that FLASH\_OPTCR is unlocked. If it is not the case, an unlock sequence must be used (see *[Section 4.5.1: FLASH configuration protection](#page-34-2)*).

*Note: The application software must not unlock a register that is already unlocked, otherwise this register will remain locked until next system reset.*

> If needed, the application software can update the programming delay and programming parallelism as described at the end of this section.

### **Single write sequence**

The recommended single write sequence in bank 1/2 is the following:

- 1. Unlock the FLASH\_CR1/2 register, as described in *Section [4.5.1: FLASH configuration](#page-34-2)  [protection](#page-34-2)* (only if register is not already unlocked).
- 2. Enable write operations by setting the PG1/2 bit in the FLASH\_CR1/2 register.
- 3. Check the protection of the targeted memory area.
- 4. Write one flash-word corresponding to 32-byte data starting at a 32-byte aligned address.
- 5. Check that QW1 (respectively QW2) has been raised and wait until it is reset to 0.

If step 4 is executed incrementally (e.g. byte per byte), the write buffer can become partially filled. In this case the application software can decide to force-write what is stored in the write buffer by using FW1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register. In this particular case, the unwritten bits are automatically set to 1. If no bit in the write buffer is cleared to 0, the FW1/2 bit has no effect.

![](_page_15_Picture_20.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 169/3556

*Note: Using a force-write operation prevents the application from updating later the missing bits with a value different from 1, which is likely to lead to a permanent ECC error.*

> *Any write access requested while the PG1/2 bit is cleared to 0 is rejected. In this case, no error is generated on the bus, but the PGSERR1/2 flag is raised.*

*Clearing the programming sequence error (PGSERR) and inconsistency error (INCERR) is mandatory before attempting a write operation (see Section [4.7: FLASH error management](#page-46-0) for details).*

### **Adjusting programming timing constraints**

Program operation timing constraints depend of the embedded flash memory clock frequency, which directly impacts the performance. If timing constraints are too tight, the non-volatile memory will not operate correctly, if they are too lax, the programming speed will not be optimal.

The user must therefore trim the optimal programming delay through the WRHIGHFREQ parameter in the FLASH\_ACR register. Refer to *[Table 16](#page-12-0)* in *[Section 4.3.8: FLASH read](#page-10-0)  [operations](#page-10-0)* for the recommended programming delay depending on the embedded flash memory clock frequency.

FLASH\_ACR configuration register is common to both banks.

The application software must check that no program/erase operation is ongoing before modifying WRHIGHFREQ parameter.

**Caution:** Modifying WRHIGHFREQ while programming/erasing the flash memory might corrupt the flash memory content.

## **Adjusting programming parallelism**

The parallelism is the maximum number of bits that can be written to 0 in one shot during a write operation. The programming parallelism is also used during sector and bank erase.

There is no hardware limitation on programming parallelism. The user can select different parallelisms depending on the application requirements: the lower the parallelism, the lower the peak consumption during a programming operation, but the longer the execution time.

The parallelism is configured through the PSIZE1/2 bits in FLASH\_CR1/2 register. Two distinct values can be defined for bank 1 and 2 (refer to *[Table 17\)](#page-16-0).*

<span id="page-16-0"></span>**PSIZE1/2 Parallelism** 00 8 bits (one byte) 01 16 bits 10 32 bits 11 64 bits

**Table 17. FLASH parallelism parameter** 

**Caution:** Modifying PSIZE1/2 while programming/erasing the flash memory might corrupt the flash memory content.

### **Programming errors**

When a program operation fails, an error can be reported as described in *[Section 4.7:](#page-46-0)  [FLASH error management](#page-46-0)*.

![](_page_16_Picture_24.jpeg)

### **Programming interrupts**

See *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details.

# <span id="page-17-0"></span>**4.3.10 FLASH erase operations**

### **Erase operation overview**

The embedded flash memory can perform erase operations on 128-Kbyte user sectors, on one user flash memory bank or on two user flash memory banks (i.e. mass erase).

*Note: System flash memory cannot be erased by the application software.*

The erase operation forces all non-volatile bit cells to high state, which corresponds to the virgin state. It clears existing data and corresponding ECC, allowing a new write operation to be performed. If the application software reads back a word that has been erased, all the bits will be read at 1, without ECC error.

Erase operations are similar to read or program operations except that the commands are queued in a special buffer (a two-command deep erase queue).

Erase commands are issued through the AHB configuration interface. If the embedded flash memory receives simultaneously a write and an erase request for the same bank, both operations are accepted but the write operation is executed first.

*Note: If data cache is enabled after a flash erase operation, it is recommended to invalidate the cache by software to avoid reading old data.*

### **Erase and security**

A user sector can be erased only if it does not contain PCROP, secure-only or writeprotected data (see *[Section 4.5: FLASH protection mechanisms](#page-34-1)* for details). In other words, if the application software attempts to erase a user sector with at least one flash word that is protected, the sector erase operation is aborted and the WRPERR1/2 flag is raised in the FLASH\_SR1/2 register, as described in *[Section 4.7.2: Write protection error \(WRPERR\)](#page-46-1)*.

The embedded flash memory allows the application software to perform an erase followed by an automatic protection removal (PCROP, secure-only area and write protection), as described hereafter.

### **Enabling erase operations**

Before erasing a sector in bank 1 (respectively bank 2), the application software must make sure that FLASH\_CR1 (respectively FLASH\_CR2) is unlocked. If it is not the case, an unlock sequence must be used (see *[Section 4.5.1: FLASH configuration protection](#page-34-2)*).

*Note: The application software must not unlock a register that is already unlocked, otherwise this register will remain locked until next system reset.* 

Similar constraints apply to bank erase requests.

RM0399 Rev 4 171/3556

### **Flash sector erase sequence**

To erase a 128-Kbyte user sector, proceed as follows:

- 1. Check and clear (optional) all the error flags due to previous programming/erase operation. Refer to *Section [4.7: FLASH error management](#page-46-0)* for details.
- 2. Unlock the FLASH\_CR1/2 register, as described in *Section [4.5.1: FLASH configuration](#page-34-2)  [protection](#page-34-2)* (only if register is not already unlocked).
- 3. Set the SER1/2 bit and SNB1/2 bitfield in the corresponding FLASH\_CR1/2 register. SER1/2 indicates a sector erase operation, while SNB1/2 contains the target sector number.
- 4. Set the START1/2 bit in the FLASH\_CR1/2 register.
- 5. Wait for the QW1/2 bit to be cleared in the corresponding FLASH\_SR1/2 register.

*Note: If a bank erase is requested simultaneously to the sector erase (BER1/2 bit set), the bank erase operation supersedes the sector erase operation.*

### **Standard flash bank erase sequence**

To erase all bank sectors except for those containing secure-only and protected data, proceed as follows:

- 1. Check and clear (optional) all the error flags due to previous programming/erase operation. Refer to *Section [4.7: FLASH error management](#page-46-0)* for details.
- 2. Unlock the FLASH\_CR1/2 register, as described in *Section [4.5.1: FLASH configuration](#page-34-2)  [protection](#page-34-2)* (only if register is not already unlocked).
- 3. Set the BER1/2 bit in the FLASH\_CR1/2 register corresponding to the targeted bank.
- 4. Set the START1/2 bit in the FLASH\_CR1/2 register to start the bank erase operation. Then wait until the QW1/2 bit is cleared in the corresponding FLASH\_SR1/2 register.

*Note: BER1/2 and START1/2 bits can be set together, so above steps 3 and 4 can be merged. If a sector erase is requested simultaneously to the bank erase (SER1/2 bit set), the bank erase operation supersedes the sector erase operation.*

### <span id="page-19-0"></span>**Flash bank erase with automatic protection-removal sequence**

To erase all bank sectors including those containing secure-only and protected data without performing an RDP regression (see *[Section 4.5.3](#page-37-0)*), proceed as follows:

- 1. Check and clear (optional) all the error flags due to previous programming/erase operation. Refer to *Section [4.7: FLASH error management](#page-46-0)* for details.
- 2. Unlock FLASH\_OPTCR register, as described in *Section [4.5.1: FLASH configuration](#page-34-2)  [protection](#page-34-2)* (only if register is not already unlocked).
- 3. If a PCROP-protected area exists set DMEP1/2 bit in FLASH\_PRAR\_PRG1/2 register. In addition, program the PCROP area end and start addresses so that the difference is negative, i.e. PROT\_AREA\_END1/2 < PROT\_AREA\_START1/2.
- 4. If a secure-only area exists set DMES1/2 bit in FLASH\_SCAR\_PRG1/2 register. In addition, program the secure-only area end and start addresses so that the difference is negative, i.e. SEC\_AREA\_END1/2 < SEC\_AREA\_START1/2.
- 5. Set all WRPSn1/2 bits in FLASH\_WPSN\_PRG1/2R to 1 to disable all sector write protection.
- 6. Unlock FLASH\_CR1/2 register, only if register is not already unlocked.
- 7. Set the BER1/2 bit in the FLASH\_CR1/2 register corresponding to the target bank.
- 8. Set the START1/2 bit in the FLASH\_CR1/2 register to start the bank erase with protection removal operation. Then wait until the QW1/2 bit is cleared in the corresponding FLASH\_SR1/2 register. At that point a bank erase operation has erased the whole bank including the sectors containing PCROP-protected and/or secure-only data, and an option byte change has been automatically performed so that all the protections are disabled.

*Note: BER1/2 and START1/2 bits can be set together, so above steps 8 and 9 can be merged.*

Be aware of the following warnings regarding to above sequence:

- It is not possible to perform the above sequence on one bank while modifying the protection parameters of the other bank.
- No other option bytes than the one indicated above must be changed, and no protection change must be performed in the bank that is not targeted by the bank erase with protection removal request.
- When one or both of the events above occurs, a simple bank erase occurs, no option byte change is performed and no option change error is set.

### **Flash mass erase sequence**

To erase all sectors of both banks simultaneously, excepted for those containing secureonly and protected data, the application software can set the MER bit to 1 in FLASH\_OPTCR register, as described below:

- 1. Check and clear (optional) all the error flags due to previous programming/erase operation. Refer to *Section [4.7: FLASH error management](#page-46-0)* for details.
- 2. Unlock the two FLASH\_CR1/2 registers and FLASH\_OPTCR register, as described in *Section [4.5.1: FLASH configuration protection](#page-34-2)* (only if the registers are not already unlocked).
- 3. Set the MER bit to 1 in FLASH\_OPTCR register. It automatically sets BER1, BER2, START1 and START2 to 1, thus launching a bank erase operation on both banks. Then wait until both QW1 and QW2 bits are cleared in the corresponding FLASH\_SR1/2 register.

![](_page_19_Picture_22.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 173/3556

### **Flash mass erase with automatic protection-removal sequence**

To erase all sectors of both banks simultaneously, including those containing secure-only and protected data, and without performing an RDP regression, proceed as follows:

- 1. Check and clear (optional) all the error flags due to previous programming/erase operation.
- 2. Unlock the two FLASH\_CR1/2 registers and FLASH\_OPTCR register (only if the registers are not already unlocked).
- 3. If a PCROP-protected area exists, set DMEP1/2 bit in FLASH\_PRAR\_PRG1/2 register. In addition, program the PCROP area end and start addresses so that the difference is negative. This operation must be performed for both banks.
- 4. If a secure-only area exists, set DMES1/2 bit in FLASH\_SCAR\_PRG1/2 register. In addition, program the secure-only area end and start addresses so that the difference is negative. This operation must be performed for both banks.
- 5. Set all WRPSn1/2 bits in FLASH\_WPSN\_PRG1/2R to 1 to disable all sector write protections. This operation must be performed for both banks.
- 6. Set the MER bit to 1 in FLASH\_OPTCR register, then wait until the QW1/2 bit is cleared in the corresponding FLASH\_SR1/2 register. At that point, a flash bank erase with automatic protection removal is executed on both banks. The sectors containing PCROP-protected and/or secure-only data become unprotected since an option byte change is automatically performed after the mass erase so that all the protections are disabled.

**Caution:** No other option bytes than the ones mentioned in the above sequence must be changed, otherwise a simple mass erase is executed, no option byte change is performed and no option change error is raised.

## **4.3.11 FLASH parallel operations**

As the non-volatile memory is divided into two independent banks, the embedded flash memory interface can drive different operations at the same time on each bank. For example a read, write or erase operation can be executed on bank 1 while another read, write or erase operation is executed on bank 2.

In all cases, the sequences described in *[Section 4.3.8: FLASH read operations](#page-10-0)*, *[Section 4.3.9: FLASH program operations](#page-13-0)* and *[Section 4.3.10: FLASH erase operations](#page-17-0)* apply.

## <span id="page-20-0"></span>**4.3.12 Flash memory error protections**

### **Error correction codes (ECC)**

The embedded flash memory supports an error correction code (ECC) mechanism. It is based on the SECDED algorithm in order to correct single errors and detects double errors.

This mechanism uses 10 ECC bits per 256-bit flash word, and applies to user and system flash memory.

More specifically, during each read operation from a 256-bit flash word, the embedded flash memory also retrieves the 10-bit ECC information, computes the ECC of the flash word, and compares the result with the reference value. If they do not match, the corresponding ECC error is raised as described in *[Section 4.7.7: Error correction code error](#page-49-0)  [\(SNECCERR/DBECCERR\)](#page-49-0)*.

![](_page_20_Picture_21.jpeg)

During each program operation, a 10- bit ECC code is associated to each 256-bit data flash word, and the resulting 266-bit flash word information is written in non-volatile memory.

### **Cyclic redundancy codes (CRC)**

The embedded flash memory implements a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) hardware module. This module checks the integrity of a given user flash memory area content (see *[Figure 6: Detailed FLASH architecture](#page-3-0)*).

The area processed by the CRC module can be defined either by sectors or by start/end addresses. It can also be defined as the whole bank (user flash memory area only).

*Note: Only one CRC check operation on bank 1 or 2 can be launched at a time. To avoid corruption, do not configure the CRC calculation on the one bank, while calculating the CRC on the other bank.* 

> When enabled, the CRC hardware module performs multiple reads by chunks of 4, 16, 64 or 256 consecutive flash-word (i.e. chunks of 128, 512, 2048 or 8192 bytes). These consecutive read operations are pushed by the CRC module into the required read command queue together with other AXI read requests, thus avoiding to deny AXI read commands.

CRC computation uses CRC-32 (Ethernet) polynomial 0x4C11DB7:

$$X^{32}+X^{26}+X^{23}+X^{22}+X^{16}+X^{12}+X^{11}+X^{10}+X^{8}+X^{7}+X^{5}+X^{4}+X^{2}+X+1$$

The CRC operation is concurrent with option byte change as the same hardware is used for both operations. To avoid the CRC computation from being corrupted, the application shall complete the option byte change (by reading the result of the change) before running a CRC operation, and vice-versa.

The sequence recommended to configure a CRC operation in the bank 1/2 is the following:

- 1. Unlock FLASH\_CR1/2 register, if not already unlocked.
- 2. Enable the CRC feature by setting the CRC\_EN bit in FLASH\_CR1/2.
- 3. Program the desired data size in the CRC\_BURST field of FLASH\_CRCCR1/2.
- 4. Define the user flash memory area on which the CRC has to be computed.Two solutions are possible:
  - Define the area start and end addresses by programing FLASH\_CRCSADD1/2R and FLASH\_CRCEADD1/2R, respectively,
  - or select the targeted sectors by setting the CRC\_BY\_SECT bit in FLASH\_CRCCR1/2 and by programming consecutively the target sector numbers in the CRC\_SECT field of the FLASH\_CRCCR1/2 register. Set ADD\_SECT bit after each CRC\_SECT programming.
- 5. Start the CRC operation by setting the START\_CRC bit.
- 6. Wait until the CRC\_BUSY1/2 flag is reset in FLASH\_SR1/2 register.
- 7. Retrieve the CRC result in the FLASH\_CRCDATAR register.

The CRC can be computed for a whole bank by setting the ALL\_BANK bit in the FLASH\_CRCCR1/2 register.

*Note: The application should avoid running a CRC on PCROP- or secure-only user flash memory area since it may alter the expected CRC value. A special error flag defined in Section [4.7.10: CRC read error \(CRCRDERR\)](#page-50-0) can be used to detect such a case.*

> *CRC computation does not raise standard read error flags such as RDSERR1/2, RDPERR1/2 and DBECCERR1/2. Only CRCRDERR1/2 is raised.*

### **Flash bank swapping**

The embedded flash memory bank 1 and bank 2 can be swapped in the memory map accessible through AXI interface. This feature can be used after a firmware upgrade to restart the device on the new firmware. Bank swapping is controlled by the SWAP\_BANK bit of the FLASH\_OPTCR register.

*[Table 18](#page-22-1)* shows the memory map that can be accessed from the embedded flash memory AXI slave interface, depending on the SWAP\_BANK bit configuration.

**Table 18. FLASH AXI interface memory map vs swapping option**

The SWAP\_BANK bit in FLASH\_OPTCR register is loaded from the SWAP\_BANK\_OPT option bit **only after system reset or POR**.

To change the SWAP\_BANK bit (for example to apply a new firmware update), respect the sequence below:

- 1. Unlock OPTLOCK bit, if not already unlocked.
- 2. Set the new desired SWAP\_BANK\_OPT value in the FLASH\_OPTSR\_PRG register.
- 3. Start the option byte change sequence by setting the OPTSTART bit in the FLASH\_OPTCR register.
- 4. Once the option byte change has completed, FLASH\_OPTSR\_CUR contains the expected SWAP\_BANK\_OPT value, but SWAP\_BANK bit in FLASH\_OPTCR has not yet been modified and the bank swapping is not yet effective.
- 5. Force a system reset or a POR. When the reset rises up, the bank swapping is effective (SWAP\_BANK value updated in FLASH\_OPTCR) and the new firmware shall be executed.

*Note: The SWAP\_BANK bit in FLASH\_OPTCR is read-only and cannot be modified by the application software.*

> *The SWAP\_BANK\_OPT option bit in FLASH\_OPTSR\_PRG can be modified whatever the RDP level (i.e. even in level 2), thus allowing advanced firmware upgrade in any level of readout protection.*

# **Configuration and option byte register swapping**

The embedded flash memory bank swapping option controlled by the SWAP\_BANK bit also swaps the two sets of configuration and option byte registers, as shown in *[Table 19](#page-24-0)*. One set of registers is related to bank 1 while the other is related to bank 2. Since some registers are not specific to any particular bank, they are mapped onto two different addresses so that the swapping does not affect the access to these registers.

# **4.3.14 FLASH reset and clocks**

### **Reset management**

The embedded flash memory can be reset by a D1 domain reset (d1\_rst), driven by the reset and clock control (RCC). The main effects of this reset are the following:

- All registers, except for option byte registers, are cleared, including read and write latencies. If the bank swapping option is changed, it will be applied.
- Most control registers are automatically protected against write operations. To unprotect them, new unlock sequences must be used as described in *[Section 4.5.1:](#page-34-2)  [FLASH configuration protection](#page-34-2)*.

The embedded flash memory can be reset by a power-on reset (po\_rst), driven by the reset and clock control (RCC). When the reset falls, all option byte registers are reset. When the reset rises up, the option bytes are loaded, potentially applying new features. During this loading sequence, the device remains under reset and the embedded flash memory is not accessible.

The Reset signal can have a critical impact on the embedded flash memory:

- The contents of the flash memory are not guaranteed if a device reset occurs during a flash memory write or erase operation.
- If a reset occurs while the option byte modification is ongoing, the old option byte values are kept. When it occurs, a new option byte modification sequence is required to program the new values.

### **Clock management**

The embedded flash memory uses the microcontroller system clock (sys\_ck), here the AXI interface clock.

Depending on the device clock and internal supply voltage, specific read and write latency settings usually need to be set in the flash access control register (FLASH\_ACR), as explained in *[Section 4.3.8: FLASH read operations](#page-10-0)* and *[Section 4.3.9: FLASH program](#page-13-0)  [operations](#page-13-0)*.

# <span id="page-25-0"></span>**4.4 FLASH option bytes**

## **4.4.1 About option bytes**

The embedded flash memory includes a set of non-volatile option bytes. They are loaded at power-on reset and can be read and modified only through configuration registers.

These option bytes are configured by the end-user depending on the application requirements. Some option bytes might have been initialized by STMicroelectronics during manufacturing stage.

This section documents:

- When option bytes are loaded
- How application software can modify them
- What is the detailed list of option bytes, together with their default factory values (i.e. before the first option byte change).

![](_page_25_Picture_22.jpeg)

# **4.4.2 Option byte loading**

There are multiple ways of loading the option bytes into embedded flash memory:

### **1. Power-on wakeup**

When the device is first powered, the embedded flash memory automatically loads all the option bytes. During the option byte loading sequence, the device remains under reset and the embedded flash memory cannot be accessed.

### **2. Wakeup from system Standby**

When the D1 power domain, which contains the embedded flash memory, is switched from DStandby mode to DRun mode, the embedded flash memory behaves as during a power-on sequence.

#### **3. Dedicated option byte reloading by the application**

When the user application successfully modifies the option byte content through the embedded flash memory registers, the non-volatile option bytes are programmed and the embedded flash memory automatically reloads all option bytes to update the option registers.

*Note: The option bytes read sequence is enhanced thanks to a specific error correction code.*

*In case of security issue, the option bytes may be loaded with default values (see Section [4.4.3: Option byte modification](#page-26-0)).*

## <span id="page-26-0"></span>**4.4.3 Option byte modification**

## <span id="page-26-1"></span>**Changing user option bytes**

A user option byte change operation can be used to modify the configuration and the protection settings saved in the non-volatile option byte area of memory bank 1.

The embedded flash memory features two sets of option byte registers:

- The first register set contains the current values of the option bytes. Their names have the \_CUR extension. All "\_CUR" registers are read-only. Their values are automatically loaded from the non-volatile memory after power-on reset, wakeup from system standby or after an option byte change operation.
- The second register set allows the modification of the option bytes. Their names contain the \_PRG extension. All "\_PRG" registers can be accessed in read/write mode.

When the OPTLOCK bit in FLASH\_OPTCR register is set, modifying the \_PRG registers is not possible.

When OPTSTART bit is set to 1, the embedded flash memory checks if at least one option byte needs to be programmed by comparing the current values (\_CUR) with the new ones (\_PRG). If this is the case and all the other conditions are met (see *[Changing security option](#page-27-0)  [bytes](#page-27-0)*), the embedded flash memory launches the option byte modification in its non-volatile memory and updates the option byte registers with \_CUR extension.

If one of the condition described in *[Changing security option bytes](#page-27-0)* is not respected, the embedded flash memory sets the OPTCHANGEERR flag to 1 in the FLASH\_OPTSR\_CUR register and aborts the option byte change operation. In this case, the \_PRG registers are not overwritten by current option value. The user application can check what was wrong in their configuration.

![](_page_26_Picture_22.jpeg)

# **Unlocking the option byte modification**

After reset, the OPTLOCK bit is set to 1 and the FLASH\_OPTCR is locked. As a result, the application software must unlock the option configuration register before attempting to change the option bytes. The FLASH\_OPTCR unlock sequence is described in *[Section 4.5.1: FLASH configuration protection](#page-34-2)*.

### **Option byte modification sequence**

To modify user option bytes, follow the sequence below:

- 1. Unlock FLASH\_OPTCR register as described in *Section [4.5.1: FLASH configuration](#page-34-2)  [protection](#page-34-2)*, unless the register is already unlocked.
- 2. Write the desired new option byte values in the corresponding option registers (FLASH\_XXX\_PRG1/2).
- 3. Set the option byte start change OPTSTART bit to 1 in the FLASH\_OPTCR register.
- 4. Wait until OPT\_BUSY bit is cleared.

*Note: If a reset or a power-down occurs while the option byte modification is ongoing, the original option byte value is kept. A new option byte modification sequence is required to program the new value.*

### <span id="page-27-0"></span>**Changing security option bytes**

On top of OPTLOCK bit, there is a second level of protection for security-sensitive option byte fields. Specific rules must be followed to update them:

### • **Readout protection (RDP)**

A detailed description of RDP option bits is given in *[Section 4.5.3](#page-37-0)*. The following rules must be respected to modify these option bits:

- When RDP is set to level 2, no changes are allowed (except for the SWAP bit). As a result, if the user application attempts to reduce the RDP level, an option byte change error is raised (OPTCHANGEERR bit in FLASH\_OPTSR\_CUR register), and all the programmed changes are ignored.
- When the RDP is set to level 1, requiring a change to level 2 is always allowed. When requiring a regression to level 0, an option byte change error can occur if some of the recommendations provided in this chapter have not been followed.
- When the RDP is set to level 0, switching to level 1 or level 2 is possible without any restriction.

## • **Sector write protection (WRPSn1/2)**

These option bytes manage sector write protection in FLASH\_WPSN\_CUR1/2R registers. They can be changed without any restriction when the RDP protection level is different from level 2.

### • **PCROP area size (PROT\_AREA\_START1/2 and PROT\_AREA\_END1/2)**

These option bytes configure the size of the PCROP areas in FLASH\_PRAR\_CUR1/2 registers. They can be increased without any restriction by the Arm® Cortex®-M7 core. To remove or reduce a PCROP area, an RDP level 1 to 0 regression (see *[Section 4.5.3](#page-37-0)*) or a bank erase with protection removal (see *[Section 4.3.10](#page-17-0)*) must be

![](_page_27_Picture_23.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 181/3556

requested at the same time. DMEP must be set to 1 in either FLASH\_PRAR\_CUR1/2 or FLASH\_PRAR\_PRG1/2, otherwise an option byte change error is raised.

### • **DMEP1/2**

When this option bit is set, the content of the corresponding PCROP area is erased during a RDP level 1 to 0 regression (see *[Section 4.5.3](#page-37-0)*) or a bank erase with protection removal (see *[Section 4.3.10](#page-17-0)*). It is preserved otherwise.

There are no restrictions in setting DMEP1/2 bit. Resetting DMEP1/2 bit from 1 to 0 can only be done when an RDP level 1 to 0 regression or a bank erase with protection removal is requested at the same time.

### • **Secure access mode (SECURITY)**

The SECURITY option bit activates the secure access mode described in *[Section 4.5.5](#page-42-0)*. This option bit can be freely set by the application software if such mode is activated on the device. If at least one PCROP or secure-only area is defined as not null, the only way to deactivate the security option bit (from 1 to 0) is to perform an RDP level 1 to 0 regression, when DMEP1/2 is set to 1 in either FLASH\_PRAR\_CUR1/2 or FLASH\_PRAR\_PRG1/2 registers, and DMES1/2 is set to 1 in either FLASH\_SCAR\_CUR1/2 or FLASH\_SCAR\_PRG1/2.

If no valid secure-only area and no valid PCROP area are currently defined, the SECURITY option bit can be freely reset.

*Note: It is recommended to have both SEC\_AREA\_START> SEC\_AREA\_END and PROT\_AREA\_START> PROT\_AREA\_END programmed when deactivating the SECURITY option bit during an RDP level 1 to 0 regression.*

### • **Secure-only area size (SEC\_AREA\_START1/2 and SEC\_AREA\_END1/2)**

These option bytes configure the size of the secure-only areas in FLASH\_SCAR\_CUR1/2 registers. They can be changed without any restriction by the user secure application or by the ST secure library running on the device. For user nonsecure application, the secure-only area size can be removed by performing a bank erase with protection removal (see *[Section 4.3.10](#page-17-0)*), or an RDP level 1 to 0 regression when DMES1/2 set to 1 in either FLASH\_SCAR\_CUR1/2 or FLASH\_SCAR\_PRG1/2 (otherwise an option byte change error is raised).

## • **DMES1/2**

When this option bit is set, the content of the corresponding secure-only area is erased during an RDP level 1 to 0 regression or a bank erase with protection removal, it is preserved otherwise.

DMES1/2 bits can be set without any restriction. Resetting DMES1/2 bit from 1 to 0 can only be performed when an RDP level 1 to 0 regression or a bank erase with protection removal is requested at the same time.

**Table 20. Option byte organization (continued)**

# **4.4.5 Description of user and system option bytes**

Below the list of the general-purpose option bytes that can be used by the application:

- Watchdog management
  - IWDG\_FZ\_STOP: independent watchdogs (IWDG1 and 2) counter active in Stop mode if 1 (stop counting or freeze if 0)
  - IWDG\_FZ\_SDBY: independent watchdogs (IWDG1 and 2) counter active in Standby mode if 1 (stop counting or freeze if 0)
  - IWDG1\_SW: hardware (0) or software (1) IWDG1 watchdog control selection
  - IWDG2\_SW: hardware (0) or software (1) IWDG2 watchdog control selection

*Note: If the hardware watchdog "control selection" feature is enabled (set to 0), the corresponding watchdog is automatically enabled at power-on, thus generating a reset unless the watchdog key register is written to or the down-counter is reloaded before the end-of-count is reached.*

> *Depending on the configuration of IWDG\_STOP and IWDG\_STBY options, the IWDG can continue counting (1) or not (0) when the device is in Stop or Standby mode, respectively. When the IWDG is kept running during Stop or Standby mode, it can wake up the device from these modes.*

- Reset management
  - BOR: Brownout level option, indicating the supply level threshold that activates/releases the reset (see *Section 7.5.2: Brownout reset (BOR)*)
  - NRST\_STDBY\_D1/2: generates a reset when D1 (respectively D2) domain enters DStandby mode. It is active low.
  - NRST\_STOP\_D1/2: generates a reset when D1 (respectively D2) domain enters DStop mode. It is active low.

RM0399 Rev 4 185/3556

*Note: Whenever a Standby (respectively Stop) mode entry sequence is successfully executed, the device is reset instead of entering Standby (respectively Stop) mode if NRST\_STDBY (respectively NRST\_STOP) is cleared to 0.*

- Bank swapping (see *[Section 4.3.13 on page 176](#page-22-0)*) SWAP\_BANK\_OPT: bank swapping option, set to 1 to swap user sectors and registers after boot.
- Device options
  - IO\_HSLV: I/O speed optimization at low-voltage if set to 1.

When STMicroelectronics delivers the device, the values programmed in the generalpurpose option bytes are the following:

- Watchdog management
  - IWDG1 and IWDG2 active in Standby and Stop modes (option byte value = 0x1)
  - IWDG1 and IWDG2 not automatically enabled at power-on (option byte value = 0x1)
- Reset management:
  - BOR: brownout level option (reset level) equals brownout reset threshold 0 (option byte value = 0x0)
  - A reset is not generated when D1 or D2 domain enters DStandby or DStop lowpower mode (option byte value = 0x1)
- No bank swapping (option byte value = 0x0)
- Device working in the full voltage range with I/O speed optimization at low-voltage disabled (IO\_HSLV=0)

Refer to *[Section 4.9: FLASH registers](#page-54-0)* for details.

# <span id="page-33-0"></span>**4.4.6 Description of data protection option bytes**

Below the list of the option bytes that can be used to enhance data protection:

- RDP[7:0]: Readout protection level (see *[Section 4.5.3 on page 191](#page-37-0)* for details).
- WRPSn1/2: write protection option of the corresponding Bank 1 (respectively Bank 2) sector. It is active low. Refer to *[Section 4.5.4 on page 195](#page-41-0)* for details.
- PROT\_AREAx: Proprietary code readout protection (refer to *[Section 4.5.4 on page 195](#page-41-0)* for details)
  - PROT\_AREA\_START1 (respectively PROT\_AREA\_END1) contains the first (respectively last) 256-byte block of the PCROP zone in Bank 1
  - PROT\_AREA\_START2 (respectively PROT\_AREA\_END2) contains the first (respectively last) 256-byte block of the PCROP zone in Bank 2
  - DMEP1/2: when set to 1, the PCROP area in Bank 1 (respectively Bank 2) is erased during a RDP protection level regression (change from level 1 to 0) or a bank erase with protection removal.
- SEC\_AREAx: secure access only zones definition (refer to *[Section 4.5.5 on page 196](#page-42-0)* for details).
  - SEC\_AREA\_START1 (respectively SEC\_AREA\_END1) contains the first (respectively last) 256-byte block of the secure access only zone in Bank 1
  - SEC\_AREA\_START2 (respectively SEC\_AREA\_END2) contains the first (respectively last) 256-byte block of the secure access only zone in Bank 2
  - DMES1/2: when set to 1 the secure access only zone in Bank 1 (respectively Bank 2) is erased during a RDP protection level regression (change from level 1 to 0), or a bank erase with protection removal.
- SECURITY: this non-volatile option can be used by the application to manage secure access mode, as described in *[Section 4.5.5](#page-42-0)*.
- ST\_RAM\_SIZE: this non-volatile option defines the amount of DTCM RAM root secure services (RSS) can use during execution when the SECURITY bit is set. The DTCM RAM is always fully available for the application whatever the option byte configuration.

When STMicroelectronics delivers the device, the values programmed in the data protection option bytes are the following:

- RDP level 0 (option byte value = 0xAA)
- Flash bank erase operations do not impact secure-only and PCROP data areas when enabled by the application (DMES1/2=DMEP1/2=0)
- PCROP and secure-only zone protections disabled (start addresses higher than end addresses)
- Write protection enabled (all option byte bits set to 1)
- Secure access mode disabled (SECURITY option byte value = 0)
- RSS can use the DTCM RAM for executing its services (ST\_RAM\_SIZE=00)

# <span id="page-34-0"></span>**4.4.7 Description of boot address option bytes**

Below the list of option bytes that can be used to configure the appropriate boot address for your application:

- Arm® Cortex®-M7 boot options
  - BOOT\_CM7: option bit to enable Arm® Cortex®-M7 boot, when set to 1.
  - BOOT\_CM7\_ADD0/1: MSB of the Arm® Cortex®-M7 boot address when the BOOT pin is low (respectively high)
- Arm® Cortex®-M4 boot options
  - BOOT\_CM4: option bit to enable Arm® Cortex®-M4 boot, when set to 1.
  - BOOT\_CM4\_ADD0/1: MSB of the Arm® Cortex®-M4 boot address when the BOOT pin is low (respectively high)

When STMicroelectronics delivers the device, the values programmed in the BOOT ADDRESS option bytes are the following:

- Arm® Cortex®-M7 boot: enabled (0x1) with the MSB of the boot address equal to 0x0800 (BOOT pin low for user flash memory) and 0x1FF0 (BOOT pin high for System flash memory)
- Arm® Cortex®-M4 boot: enabled (0x1) with the MSB of the boot address equal to 0x0810 (BOOT pin low) and 0x1000 (BOOT pin high)

Refer to *[Section 4.9: FLASH registers](#page-54-0)* for details.

# <span id="page-34-1"></span>**4.5 FLASH protection mechanisms**

Since sensitive information can be stored in the flash memory, it is important to protect it against unwanted operations such as reading confidential areas, illegal programming of protected area, or illegal flash memory erasing.

The embedded flash memory implements the following protection mechanisms that can be used by end-user applications to manage the security of embedded non-volatile storage:

- Configuration protection
- Global device Readout protection (RDP)
- Write protection
- Proprietary code readout protection (PCROP)
- Secure access mode areas

This section provides a detailed description of all these security mechanisms.

# <span id="page-34-2"></span>**4.5.1 FLASH configuration protection**

The embedded flash memory uses hardware mechanisms to protect the following assets against unwanted or spurious modifications (e.g. software bugs):

- Option bytes change
- Write operations
- Erase commands
- Interrupt masking

![](_page_34_Picture_30.jpeg)

More specifically, write operations to embedded flash memory control registers (FLASH\_CR1/2 and FLASH\_OPTCR) are not allowed after reset.

The following sequence must be used to unlock FLASH\_CR1/2 register:

- 1. Program KEY1 to 0x45670123 in FLASH\_KEYR1/2 key register.
- 2. Program KEY2 to 0xCDEF89AB in FLASH\_KEYR1/2 key register.
- 3. LOCK1/2 bit is now cleared and FLASH\_CR1/2 is unlocked.

The following sequence must be used to unlock FLASH\_OPTCR register:

- 1. Program OPTKEY1 to 0x08192A3B in FLASH\_OPTKEYR option key register.
- 2. Program OPTKEY2 to 0x4C5D6E7F in FLASH\_OPTKEYR option key register.
- 3. OPTLOCK bit is now cleared and FLASH\_OPTCR register is unlocked.

Any wrong sequence locks up the corresponding register/bit until the next system reset, and generates a bus error.

The FLASH\_CR1/2 (respectively FLASH\_OPTCR) register can be locked again by software by setting the LOCK1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register (respectively OPTLOCK bit in FLASH\_OPTCR register).

In addition the FLASH\_CR1/2 register remains locked and a bus error is generated when the following operations are executed:

- programming a third key value
- writing to a different register belonging to the same bank than FLASH\_KEYR1/2 before FLASH\_CR1/2 has been completely unlocked (KEY1 programmed but KEY2 not yet programmed)
- writing less than 32 bits to KEY1 or KEY2.

Similarly the FLASH\_OPTCR register remains locked and a bus error is generated when the following operations are executed:

- programming a third key value
- writing to a different register before FLASH\_OPTCR has been completely unlocked (OPTKEY1 programmed but OPTKEY2 not yet programmed)
- writing less than 32 bits to OPTKEY1 or OPTKEY2.

The embedded flash memory configuration registers protection is summarized in *[Table 21](#page-35-0)*.

## 4.5.2 Write protection

The purpose of embedded flash memory write protection is to protect the embedded flash memory against unwanted modifications of the non-volatile code and/or data.

Any 128-Kbyte flash sector can be independently write-protected or unprotected by clearing/setting the corresponding WRPSn1/2 bit in the FLASH\_WPSN\_PRG1/2R register.

A write-protected sector can neither be erased nor programmed. As a result, a bank erase cannot be performed if one sector is write-protected, unless a bank erase is executed during an RDP level 1 to 0 regression (see Section: Flash bank erase with automatic protection-removal sequence for details).

The embedded flash memory write-protection user option bits can be modified without any restriction when the RDP level is set to level 0 or level 1. When it is set to level 2, the write protection bitfield can no more be changed in the option bytes.

Note: PCROP or secure-only areas are write and erase protected.

Write protection errors are documented in Section 4.7: FLASH error management.

RM0399 Rev 4

# <span id="page-37-0"></span>**4.5.3 Readout protection (RDP)**

The embedded flash memory readout protection is global as it does not apply only to the embedded flash memory, but also to the other secured regions. This is done by using dedicated security signals.

In this section *other secured regions* are defined as:

- Backup SRAM
- RTC backup registers

The global readout protection level is set by writing the values given in *[Table 22](#page-37-1)* into the readout protection (RDP) option byte (see *[Section 4.4.3: Option byte modification](#page-26-0)*).

<span id="page-37-1"></span>**RDP option byte value Global readout protection level** 0xAA Level 0 0xCC Level 2 Any other value Level 1(1)

**Table 22. RDP value vs readout protection level**

## **Definitions of RDP global protection level**

### **RDP Level 0 (no protection)**

When the global read protection level 0 is set, all read/program/erase operations from/to the user flash memory are allowed (if no others protections are set). This is true whatever the boot configuration (boot from user or system flash memory, boot from RAM), and whether the debugger is connected to the device or not. Accesses to the *other secured regions* are also allowed.

### **RDP Level 1 (flash memory content protection)**

When the global read protection level 1 is set, the below properties apply:

- The flash memory content is protected against debugger and potential malicious code stored in RAM. Hence as soon as any debugger is connected or has been connected, or a boot is configured in embedded RAM (intrusion), the embedded flash memory prevents any accesses to flash memory.
- When no intrusion is detected (no boot in RAM, no boot in System flash memory and no debugger connected), all read/program/erase operations from/to the user flash memory are allowed (if no others protections are set). Accesses to the *other secured regions* are also allowed.
- When an intrusion is detected, no accesses to the user flash memory can be performed. A bus error is generated when a read access is requested to the flash

![](_page_37_Picture_19.jpeg)

<sup>1.</sup> Default protection level when RDP option byte is erased.

memory. In addition, no accesses to *other secured regions* (read or write) can be performed.

- When performing an RDP level regression, i.e. programming the RDP protection to level 0, the user flash memory and the *other secured regions* are erased, as described in *[RDP protection transitions](#page-39-2)*.
- When booting on STM32 bootloader in standard system memory, only the identification services are available (GET\_ID\_COMMAND, GET\_VER\_COMMAND and GET\_CMD\_COMMAND).
- When booting from STMicroelectronics non-secure bootloader, only the identification services are available (GET\_ID\_COMMAND, GET\_VER\_COMMAND and GET\_CMD\_COMMAND).

### **RDP Level 2 (device protection and intrusion prevention)**

When the global read protection level 2 is set, the below rules apply:

- All debugging features are disabled.
- Like level 0, all read/write/erase operations from/to the user flash memory are allowed since the debugger and the boot from RAM and System flash memory are disabled. Accesses to the *other secured regions* are also allowed.
- Booting from RAM is no more allowed.
- The user option bits described in *[Section 4.4](#page-25-0)* can no longer be changed except for the SWAP bit.

**Caution:** Memory read protection level 2 is an irreversible operation. When level 2 is activated, the level of protection cannot be changed back to level 0 or level 1.

*Note: The JTAG port is permanently disabled when level 2 is active (acting as a JTAG fuse). As a consequence. STMicroelectronics is not able to perform analysis on defective parts on which the level 2 protection has been set.*

> *Apply a power-on reset if the global read protection level 2 is set while the debugger is still connected.*

The above RDP global protection is summarized in *[Table 23](#page-38-0)*.

When the current RDP level is RDP level 1, requesting a new RDP level 0 can cause a full or partial erase:

- The user flash memory area of the embedded flash memory is fully or partially erased:
  - A partial sector erase occurs if PCROP (respectively secure-only) areas are preserved by the application. It happens when both DMEP1/2 bits (respectively DMES1/2 bits) are cleared to 0 in FLASH\_PRAR\_CUR1/2 and FLASH\_PRAR\_PRG1/2 (respectively FLASH\_SCAR\_CUR1/2 and FLASH\_SCAR\_PRG1/2). The sectors belonging to the preserved area(s) are not erased.
  - A full bank erase occurs when at least one DMEP1/2 bit is set to 1 in FLASH\_PRAR\_CUR1/2 or FLASH\_PRAR\_PRG1/2, and at least one DMES1/2 bit is set to 1 in FLASH\_SCAR\_CUR1/2 or FLASH\_SCAR\_PRG1/2.

*Note: Data in write protection area are not preserved during RDP regression.*

• The other secured regions are also erased (Backup SRAM and RTC backup registers)

During a level regression, if a PCROP area overlaps with a secure-only area, the embedded flash memory performs the erase operation depending on the DMES/DMEP options bits (see strike-through areas in red in *[Figure 14](#page-41-1)*). More specifically:

- When DMEP is set in FLASH\_PRAR\_CUR1/2 or FLASH\_PRAR\_PRG1/2, the PCROP area is erased (overlapped or not with secure-only area).
- When DMES is set in FLASH\_SCAR\_CUR1/2 or FLASH\_SCAR\_PRG1/2, the secureonly area is erased (overlapped or not with PCROP area).

*Note: The sector protections (PCROP, secure-only) are removed only if the protected sector boundaries are modified by the user application.*

<span id="page-41-1"></span>![](_page_41_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 14. Example of protected region overlapping**

### **About RDP protection errors**

Whatever the RDP level, the corresponding error flag is raised when an illegal read or write access is detected (see *[Section 4.7: FLASH error management\)](#page-46-0).*

# <span id="page-41-0"></span>**4.5.4 Proprietary code readout protection (PCROP)**

The embedded flash memory allows the definition of an "executable-only" area in the user area of each flash memory bank. In this area, only instruction fetch transactions from the system, that is no data access (data or literal pool), are allowed. This protection is particularly efficient to protect third party software intellectual property.

*Note: Executable-only area usage requires the native code to be compiled accordingly using "execute-only" option.*

### **PCROP area programming**

One PCROP area can be defined in bank 1 (respectively bank 2) by setting the PROT\_AREA\_END1 and PROT\_AREA\_START1 (respectively PROT\_AREA\_END2 and PROT\_AREA\_START2) option bytes so that the END address is strictly higher than the START address. PROT\_AREA\_START and PROT\_AREA\_END are defined with a granularity of 256 bytes. This means that the actual PCROP area size (in bytes) is defined by:

[(PROT\_AREA\_END - PROT\_AREA\_START) + 1] x 256

As an example, to set a PCROP area on the first 4 Kbytes of user bank 1 (i.e. from address 0x0800 0000 to address 0x0800 0FFF, both included), the embedded flash memory must be configured as follows:

- PROT\_AREA\_START1[11:0] = 0x000
- PROT\_AREA\_END1[11:0] = 0x00F

The protected area size defined above is equal to:

[(PROT\_AREA\_END - PROT\_AREA\_START) + 1] x 256 = 16 x 256 bytes = 4 Kbytes.

![](_page_41_Picture_18.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 195/3556

The minimum execute-only PCROP area that can be set is 16 flash words (or 512 bytes). The maximum area is the whole user flash memory, configured by setting to the same value the PCROP area START and END addresses.

*Note: It is recommended to align the PCROP area size with the flash sector granularity in order to avoid access right issues.*

### **PCROP area properties**

Each valid PCROP area has the following properties:

- Arm® Cortex®-M7 debug events are ignored while executing code in this area.
- Only the Arm®Cortex®-M7 core can access it (Master ID filtering), using only instruction fetch transactions. In all other cases, accessing the PCROP area is illegal (see below).
- Illegal transactions to a PCROP area (i.e. data read or write, not fetch) are managed as below:
  - Read operations return a zero, write operations are ignored.
  - No bus error is generated but an error flag is raised (RDPERR for read, WRPERR for write).
- A valid PCROP area is erase-protected. As a result:
  - No erase operations to a sector located in this area is possible (including the sector containing the area start address and the end address)
  - No mass erase can be performed if a single valid PCROP area is defined, except during level regression or erase with protection removal.
- Only the Arm®Cortex®-M7 core can modify the PCROP area definition and DMEP1/2 bits, as explained in *[Changing user option bytes](#page-26-1)* in *[Section 4.4.3](#page-26-0)*.
- During an RDP level 1 to 0 regression where the PCROP area is not null
  - The PCROP area content is not erased if the corresponding DMEP1/2 bit are both cleared to 0 in FLASH\_PRAR\_CUR1/2 and FLASH\_PRAR\_PRG1/2 registers.
  - The PCROP area content is erased if either of the corresponding DMEP1/2 bit is set to 1 in FLASH\_PRAR\_CUR1/2 or FLASH\_PRAR\_PRG1/2 register.

For more information on PCROP protection errors, refer to *[Section 4.7: FLASH error](#page-46-0)  [management](#page-46-0)*.

## <span id="page-42-0"></span>**4.5.5 Secure access mode**

The embedded flash memory allows the definition of a secure-only area in the user area of each flash memory bank. This area can be accessed only while the CPU executes secure application code. This feature is available only if the SECURITY option bit is set to 1.

Secure-only areas help isolating secure user code from application non-secure code. As an example, they can be used to protect a customer secure firmware upgrade code, a custom secure boot library or a third party secure library.

### **Secure-only area programming**

One secure-only area can be defined in bank 1 (respectively bank 2) by setting the SEC\_AREA\_END1 and SEC\_AREA\_START1 (respectively SEC\_AREA\_END2 and SEC\_AREA\_START2) option bytes so that the END address is strictly higher than the

![](_page_42_Picture_26.jpeg)

START address. SEC\_AREA\_START and SEC\_AREA\_END are defined with a granularity of 256 bytes. This means that the actual secure-only area size (in bytes) is defined by:

[(SEC\_AREA\_END - SEC\_AREA\_START) + 1] x 256

As an example, to set a secure-only area on the first 8 Kbytes of user bank 2 (i.e. from address 0x0810 0000 to address 0x0810 1FFF, both included), the embedded flash memory must be configured as follows:

- SEC\_AREA\_START2[11:0] = 0x000
- SEC\_AREA\_END2[11:0] = 0x01F

The secure-only area size defined above is equal to:

[(SEC\_AREA\_END - SEC\_AREA\_START) + 1] x 256 = 32 x 256 bytes = 8 Kbytes.

*Note: These option bytes can be modified only by the Arm® Cortex®-M7 core running ST security library or application secure code, except during RDP level regression or erase with protection removal.*

> The minimum secure-only area that can be set is 16 flash words (or 512 bytes). The maximum area is the whole user flash memory bank, configured by setting to the same value the secure-only area START and END addresses.

*Note: It is recommended to align the secure-only area size with flash sector granularity in order to avoid access right issues.*

## **Secure access-only area properties**

- Arm® Cortex®-M7 debug events are ignored while executing code in this area.
- Only the Arm®Cortex®-M7 core executing ST secure library or user secure application can access it (Master ID filtering). In all other cases, accessing the secure-only area is illegal (see below).
- Illegal transactions to a secure-only area are managed as follows:
  - Data read transactions return zero. Data write transactions are ignored. No bus error is generated but an error flag is raised (RDSERR for read, WRPERR for write).
  - Read instruction transactions generate a bus error and the RDSERR error flag is raised.
- A valid secure-only area is erase-protected. As a result:
  - No erase operations to a sector located in this area are possible (including the sector containing the area start address and the end address), unless the application software is executed from a valid secure-only area.
  - No mass erase can be performed if a single valid secure-only area is defined, except during level regression, erase with protection removal or when the application software is executed from a valid secure-only area.
- Only the Arm®Cortex®-M7 core can modify the secure-only area definition and DMES1/2 bits, as explained in *[Changing user option bytes](#page-26-1)* in *[Section 4.4.3](#page-26-0)*.
- During an RDP level 1 to 0 regression where the secure-only area is not null:
  - the secure-only area content is not erased if the corresponding DMES1/2 bit are both cleared to 0 in FLASH\_SCAR\_CUR1/2 and FLASH\_SCAR\_PRG1/2 registers.
  - the secure-only area content is erased if either of the corresponding DMES1/2 bit is set to 1 in FLASH\_SCAR\_CUR1/2 or FLASH\_SCAR\_PRG1/2 register.

# 4.6 FLASH low-power modes

### 4.6.1 Introduction

The table below summarizes the behavior of the embedded flash memory in the microcontroller low-power modes. The embedded flash memory belongs to the D1 domain.

Table 25. Effect of low-power modes on the embedded flash memory

<span id="page-44-0"></span>

D3 domain must always be in DStandby mode. When all clocks are stopped and both CPUs are in CStop, the VCORE domain is switched off.

When the system state changes or within a given system state, the embedded flash memory might get a different voltage supply range (VOS) according to the application. The procedure to switch the embedded flash memory into various power mode (run, clock gated, stopped, off) is described hereafter.

Note: For more information in the microcontroller power states, refer to the Power control section (PWR).

# 4.6.2 Managing the FLASH domain switching to DStop or DStandby

As explain in *Table 25*, if the embedded flash memory informs the reset and clock controller (RCC) that it is busy (i.e. BSY1/2, QW1/2, WBNE1/2 is set), the microcontroller cannot switch the D1 domain to DStop or DStandby mode.

Note: CRC\_BUSY1/2 is not taken into account.

![](_page_44_Picture_15.jpeg)

There are two ways to release the embedded flash memory:

- Reset the WBNE1/2 busy flag in FLASH\_SR1/2 register by any of the following actions:
  - a) Complete the write buffer with missing data.
  - b) Force the write operation without filling the missing data by activating the FW1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register. This forces all missing data "high".
  - c) Reset the PG1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register. This disables the write buffer and consequently lead to the loss of its content.
- Poll QW1/2 busy bits in FLASH\_SR1/2 register until they are cleared. This will indicate that all recorded write, erase and option change operations are complete.

The microcontroller can then switch the domain to DStop or DStandby mode.

# <span id="page-46-0"></span>**4.7 FLASH error management**

## **4.7.1 Introduction**

The embedded flash memory automatically reports when an error occurs during a read, program or erase operation. A wide range of errors are reported:

- *[Write protection error \(WRPERR\)](#page-46-1)*
- *[Programming sequence error \(PGSERR\)](#page-47-0)*
- *[Strobe error \(STRBERR\)](#page-48-0)*
- *[Inconsistency error \(INCERR\)](#page-48-1)*
- *[Operation error \(OPERR\)](#page-49-1)*
- *[Error correction code error \(SNECCERR/DBECCERR\)](#page-49-0)*
- *[Read protection error \(RDPERR\)](#page-50-1)*
- *[Read secure error \(RDSERR\)](#page-50-2)*
- *[CRC read error \(CRCRDERR\)](#page-50-0)*
- *[Option byte change error \(OPTCHANGEERR\)](#page-51-1)*

The application software can individually enable the interrupt for each error, as detailed in *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)*.

*Note: For some errors, the application software must clear the error flag before attempting a new operation.*

> Each bank has a dedicated set of error flags in order to identify which bank generated the error. They are available in flash Status register 1 or 2 (FLASH\_SR1/2).

# <span id="page-46-1"></span>**4.7.2 Write protection error (WRPERR)**

When an illegal erase/program operation is attempted to the non-volatile memory bank 1 (respectively bank 2), the embedded flash memory sets the write protection error flag WRPERR1 (respectively WRPERR2) in FLASH\_SR1 register (respectively FLASH\_SR2).

An erase operation is rejected and flagged as illegal if it targets one of the following memory areas:

- A sector belonging to a valid PCROP area (even partially)
- A sector belonging to a valid secure-only area (even partially) except if the application software is executed from a valid secure-only area
- A sector write-locked with WRPSn

An program operation is ignored and flagged as illegal if it targets one of the following memory areas:

- The system flash memory (bank 2 only) while the device is not executing ST bootloader code
- A user flash sector belonging to a valid PCROP area while the device is not executing an ST secure library
- A user flash sector belonging to a valid secure-only area while the device is not executing user secure code or ST secure library
- A user sector write-locked with WRPSn
- The bank 1 system flash memory
- The user main flash memory when RDP level is 1 and a debugger has been detected on the device, or an Arm® Cortex® core has not booted from user flash memory.
- A reserved area

When WRPERR1/2 flag is raised, the operation is rejected and nothing is changed in the corresponding bank. If a write burst operation was ongoing, WRPERR1/2 is raised each time a flash word write operation is processed by the embedded flash memory.

*Note: WRPERR1/2 flag does not block any new erase/program operation.*

*Not resetting the write protection error flag (WRPERR1/2) does not generate a PGSERR error.*

WRPERR1/2 flag is cleared by setting CLR\_WRPERR1/2 bit to 1 in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register.

If WRPERRIE1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register is set to 1, an interrupt is generated when WRPERR1/2 flag is raised (see *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details).

# <span id="page-47-0"></span>**4.7.3 Programming sequence error (PGSERR)**

When the programming sequence to the bank 1 (respectively bank 2) is incorrect, the embedded flash memory sets the programming sequence error flag PGSERR1 (respectively PGSERR2) in FLASH\_SR1 register (respectively FLASH\_SR2).

More specifically, PGSERR1/2 flag is set if one of below conditions is met:

- A write operation is requested but the program enable bit (PG1/2) has not been set in FLASH\_CR1/2 register prior to the request.
- The inconsistency error (INCERR1/2) has not been cleared to 0 before requesting a new write operation.

When PGSERR1/2 flag is raised, the current program operation is aborted and nothing is changed in the corresponding bank. The corresponding write data buffer is also flushed. If a write burst operation was ongoing, PGSERR1/2 is raised at the end of the burst.

*Note: When PGSERR1/2 flag is raised, there is a risk that the last write operation performed by the application has been lost because of the above protection mechanism. Hence it is recommended to generate interrupts on PGSERR and verify in the interrupt handler if the last write operation has been successful by reading back the value in the flash memory.*

> The PGSERR1/2 flag also blocks any new program operation. This means that PGSERR1 (respectively 2) must be cleared before starting a new program operation on bank 1 (respectively bank 2).

RM0399 Rev 4 201/3556

PGSERR1/2 flag is cleared by setting CLR\_PGSERR1/2 bit to 1 in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register.

If PGSERRIE1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register is set to 1, an interrupt is generated when PGSERR1/2 flag is raised. See *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details.

# <span id="page-48-0"></span>**4.7.4 Strobe error (STRBERR)**

When the application software writes several times to the same byte in bank 1 (respectively bank 2) write buffer, the embedded flash memory sets the strobe error flag STRBERR1 (respectively STRBERR2) in FLASH\_SR1 register (respectively FLASH\_SR2).

When STRBERR1/2 flag is raised, the current program operation is not aborted and new byte data replace the old ones. The application can ignore the error, proceed with the current write operation and request new write operations. If a write burst was ongoing, STRBERR1/2 is raised at the end of the burst.

STRBERR1/2 flag is cleared by setting CLR\_STRBERR1/2 bit to 1 in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register.

If STRBERRIE1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register is set to 1, an interrupt is generated when STRBERR1/2 flag is raised. See *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details.

# <span id="page-48-1"></span>**4.7.5 Inconsistency error (INCERR)**

When a programming inconsistency to bank 1 (respectively bank 2) is detected, the embedded flash memory sets the inconsistency error flag INCERR1 (respectively INCERR2) in register FLASH\_SR1 (respectively FLASH\_SR2).

More specifically, INCERR flag is set when one of the following conditions is met:

- A write operation is attempted before completion of the previous write operation, e.g.
  - The application software starts a write operation to fill the 256-bit write buffer, but sends a new write burst request to a different flash memory address before the buffer is full.
  - One master starts a write operation, but before the buffer is full, another master starts a new write operation to the same address or to a different address.
- A wrap burst request issued by a master overlaps two or more 256-bit flash-word addresses, i.e. wrap bursts must be done within 256-bit flash-word address boundaries.

*Note: INCERR flag must be cleared before starting a new write operation, otherwise a sequence error (PGSERR) is raised.*

> It is recommended to follow the sequence below to avoid losing data when an inconsistency error occurs:

- 1. Execute a handler routine when INCERR1 or INCERR2 flag is raised.
- 2. Stop all write requests to embedded flash memory.
- 3. Verify that the write operations that have been requested just before the INCERR event have been successful by reading back the programmed values from the memory.
- 4. Clear the corresponding INCERR1/2 bit.
- 5. Restart the write operations where they have been interrupted.

INCERR1/2 flag is cleared by setting CLR\_INCERR1/2 bit to 1 in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register.

![](_page_48_Picture_25.jpeg)

If INCERRIE1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register is set to 1, an interrupt is generated when INCERR1/2 flag is raised (see *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details).

# <span id="page-49-1"></span>**4.7.6 Operation error (OPERR)**

When an error occurred during a write or an erase operation to bank 1 (respectively bank 2), the embedded flash memory sets the operation error flag OPERR1 (respectively OPERR2) in FLASH\_SR1 register (respectively FLASH\_SR2). This error may be caused by an incorrect non-volatile memory behavior due to cycling issues or to a previous modify operation stopped by a system reset.

When OPERR1/2 flag is raised, the current program/erase operation is aborted.

OPERR1/2 flag is cleared by setting CLR\_OPERR1/2 bit to 1 in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register.

If OPERRIE1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register is set to 1, an interrupt is generated when OPERR1/2 flag is raised (see *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details).

# <span id="page-49-0"></span>**4.7.7 Error correction code error (SNECCERR/DBECCERR)**

When a single error correction is detected during a read from bank 1 (respectively bank 2) the embedded flash memory sets the single error correction flag SNECCERR1 (respectively SNECCERR2) in FLASH\_SR1 register (respectively FLASH\_SR2).

When two ECC errors are detected during a read to bank 1 (respectively bank 2), the embedded flash memory sets the double error detection flag DBECCERR1 (respectively DBECCERR2) in FLASH\_SR1 register (respectively FLASH\_SR2). When SNECCERR1/2 flag is raised, the corrected read data are returned. Hence the application can ignore the error and request new read operations.

If a read burst operation was ongoing, SNECCERR1/2 or DBECCERR1/2 flag is raised each time a new data is sent back to the requester through the AXI interface.

When SNECCERR1/2 or DBECCERR1/2 flag is raised, the address of the flash word that generated the error is saved in the FLASH\_ECC\_FA1/2R register.This register is automatically cleared when the associated flag that generated the error is reset.

*Note: In case of successive single correction or double detection errors, only the address corresponding to the first error is stored in FLASH\_ECC\_FA1/2R register.*

> When DBECCERR1/2 flag is raised, a bus error is generated. In case of successive double error detections, a bus error is generated each time a new data is sent back to the requester through the AXI interface.

*Note: It is not mandatory to clear SNECCERR1/2 or DBECCERR1/2 flags before starting a new read operation.*

> SNECCERR1/2 (respectively DBECCERR1/2) flag is cleared by setting to 1 CLR\_SNECCERR1/2 bit (respectively CLR\_DBECCERR1/2 bit) in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register.

If SNECCERR1/2 (respectively DBECCERR1/2) bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register is set to 1, an interrupt is generated when SNECCERR1/2 (respectively DBECCERR1/2) flag is raised. See *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details.

RM0399 Rev 4 203/3556

# <span id="page-50-1"></span>**4.7.8 Read protection error (RDPERR)**

When a read operation to a PCROP, a secure-only or a RDP protected area is attempted in non-volatile memory bank 1 (respectively bank 2), the embedded flash memory sets the read protection error flag RDPERR1 (respectively RDPERR2) in FLASH\_SR1 register (respectively FLASH\_SR2).

When RDPERR1/2 flag is raised, the current read operation is aborted but the application can request new read operations. If a read burst was ongoing, RDPERR1/2 is raised each time a data is sent back to the requester through the AXI interface.

*Note: A bus error is raised if a standard application attempts to execute on a secure-only or a RDP protected area.*

> RDPERR1/2 flag is cleared by setting CLR\_RDPERR1/2 bit to 1 in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register.

If RDPERRIE1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register is set to 1, an interrupt is generated when RDPERR1/2 flag is raised (see *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details).

# <span id="page-50-2"></span>**4.7.9 Read secure error (RDSERR)**

When a read operation is attempted to a secure address in bank 1 (respectively bank 2), the embedded flash memory sets the read secure error flag RDSERR1 (respectively RDSERR2) in FLASH\_SR1 register (respectively FLASH\_SR2). For more information, refer to *[Section 4.5.5: Secure access mode](#page-42-0)*.

When RDSERR1/2 flag is raised, the current read operation is aborted and the application can request new read operations. If a read burst was ongoing, RDSERR1/2 is raised each time a data is sent back to the requester through the AXI interface.

*Note: The bus error is raised only if the illegal access is due to an instruction fetch.*

RDSERR1/2 flag is cleared by setting CLR\_RDSERR1/2 bit to 1 in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register.

If RDSERRIE1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register is set to 1, an interrupt is generated when RDSERR1/2 flag is raised (see *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details).

# <span id="page-50-0"></span>**4.7.10 CRC read error (CRCRDERR)**

After a CRC computation in bank 1 (respectively bank 2), the embedded flash memory sets the CRC read error flag CRCRDERR1 (respectively CRCRDERR2) in FLASH\_SR1 register (respectively FLASH\_SR2) when one or more address belonging to a protected area was read by the CRC module. A protected area corresponds to a PCROP area (see *[Section 4.5.4](#page-41-0)*) or to a secure-only area (see *[Section 4.5.5](#page-42-0)*).

CRCRDERR1/2 flag is raised when CRCEND1/2 bit is set to 1 (end of CRC calculation). In this case, it is likely that the CRC result is wrong since illegal read operations to protected areas return null values.

CRCRDERR1/2 flag is cleared by setting CLR\_CRCRDERR1/2 bit to 1 in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register.

If CRCRDERRIE1/2 bit in FLASH\_CR1/2 register is set to 1, an interrupt is generated when CRCRDERR1/2 flag is raised together with CRCEND1/2 bit (see *[Section 4.8: FLASH](#page-51-0)  [interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details).

![](_page_50_Picture_20.jpeg)

# <span id="page-51-1"></span>**4.7.11 Option byte change error (OPTCHANGEERR)**

When the embedded flash memory finds an error during an option change operation, it aborts the operation and sets the option byte change error flag OPTCHANGEERR in FLASH\_OPTSR\_CUR register.

OPTCHANGEERR flag is cleared by setting CLR\_OPTCHANGEERR bit to 1 in FLASH\_OPTCCR register.

If OPTCHANGEERRIE bit in FLASH\_OPTCR register is set to 1, an interrupt is generated when OPTCHANGEERR flag is raised (see *[Section 4.8: FLASH interrupts](#page-51-0)* for details).

## **4.7.12 Miscellaneous HardFault errors**

The following events generate a bus error on the corresponding bus interface:

- On AXI system bus:
  - accesses to user flash memory while RDP is set to 1 and a illegal condition is detected (boot from system flash memory, boot from RAM, or debugger connected)
  - fetching to secure-only user flash memory without the correct access rights
- On AHB configuration bus:
  - wrong key input to FLASH\_KEYR1/2 or FLASH\_OPTKEYR

# <span id="page-51-0"></span>**4.8 FLASH interrupts**

The embedded flash memory can generate a maskable interrupt to signal the following events on a given bank:

- Read and write errors (see *[Section 4.7: FLASH error management](#page-46-0))*
  - Single ECC error correction during read operation
  - Double ECC error detection during read operation
  - Write inconsistency error
  - Bad programming sequence
  - Strobe error during write operations
  - Non-volatile memory write/erase error (due to cycling issues)
  - option change operation error
- Security errors (see *[Section 4.7: FLASH error management\)](#page-46-0)*
  - Write protection error
  - Read protection error
  - Read secure error
  - CRC computation on PCROP or secure-only area error
- Miscellaneous events (described below)
  - End of programming
  - CRC computation complete

These multiple sources are combined into a single interrupt signal, **flash\_it**, which is the only interrupt signal from the embedded flash memory that drives the NVIC (nested vectored interrupt controller).

![](_page_51_Picture_32.jpeg)

You can individually enable or disable embedded flash memory interrupt sources by changing the mask bits in the FLASH\_CR1/2 register. Setting the appropriate mask bit to 1 enables the interrupt.

*Note: Prior to writing, FLASH\_CR1/2 register must be unlocked as explained in [Section](#page-34-2) 4.5.1: [FLASH configuration protection](#page-34-2)*

> *[Table 26](#page-52-0)* gives a summary of the available embedded flash memory interrupt features. As mentioned in the table below, some flags need to be cleared before a new operation is triggered.

- <span id="page-53-0"></span>1. Programming still possible on the AXI interface that did not trigger the inconsistency error, on the flash bank that does not have the flag bit raised. See *[Section 4.7.5: Inconsistency error \(INCERR\)](#page-48-1)* for details.
- 2. Bus error occurs only when accessing RDP protected area, as defined in *[Section 4.5.3: Readout protection \(RDP\)](#page-37-0)*

The status of the individual maskable interrupt sources described in *[Table 26](#page-52-0)* (except for option byte error) can be read from the FLASH\_SR1/2 register. They can be cleared by setting to 1 the adequate bit in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register.

*Note: No unlocking mechanism is required to clear an interrupt.*

### **End-of-program event**

Setting the end-of-operation interrupt enable bit (EOPIE1/2) in the FLASH\_CR1/2 register enables the generation of an interrupt at the end of an erase operation, a program operation or an option byte change on bank 1/2. The EOP1/2 bit in the FLASH\_SR1/2 register is also set when one of these events occurs.

Setting CLR\_EOP1/2 bit to 1 in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register clears EOP1/2 flag.

### **CRC end of calculation event**

Setting the CRC end-of-calculation interrupt enable bit (CRCENDIE1/2) in the FLASH\_CR1/2 register enables the generation of an interrupt at the end of a CRC operation on bank 1/2. The CRCEND1/2 bit in the FLASH\_SR1/2 register is also set when this event occurs.

Setting CLR\_CRCEND1/2 bit to 1 in FLASH\_CCR1/2 register clears CRCEND1/2 flag.

When CRC calculation is performed on bank 1, it can only be disabled by setting CRC\_EN bit to 0. Resetting CRC\_EN clears CRC configuration and resets the content of FLASH\_CRCDATAR register.

Clearing CRC\_EN to 0 sets CRCDATA to 0x0.

CRC\_EN can be programmed only when LOCK1 is cleared to 0.

- Bit 14 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.
- Bits 13:11 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

# Bits 10:8 **SNB1**: Bank 1 sector erase selection number

These bits are used to select the target sector for a sector erase operation (they are unused otherwise). SNB1 can be programmed only when LOCK1 is cleared to 0.

000: sector 0 of bank 1 001: sector 1 of bank 1

...

111: sector 7 of bank 1

### Bit 7 **START1**: Bank 1 erase start control bit

START1 bit is used to start a sector erase or a bank erase operation. START1 can be programmed only when LOCK1 is cleared to 0.

The embedded flash memory resets START1 when the corresponding operation has been acknowledged. The user application cannot access any embedded flash memory register until the operation is acknowledged.

![](_page_57_Picture_34.jpeg)

RM0399 Rev 4 211/3556

#### Bit 6 **FW1:** Bank 1 write forcing control bit

FW1 forces a write operation even if the write buffer is not full. In this case all bits not written are set to 1 by hardware. FW1 can be programmed only when LOCK1 is cleared to 0. The embedded flash memory resets FW1 when the corresponding operation has been acknowledged. The user application cannot access any embedded flash memory register

until the operation is acknowledged. *Note: Using a force-write operation prevents the application from updating later the missing* 

*bits with something else than 1, because it is likely that it will lead to permanent ECC error.*

Write forcing is effective only if the write buffer is not empty (in particular, FW1 does not start several write operations when the force-write operations are performed consecutively).

#### Bits 5:4 **PSIZE1**: Bank 1 program size

PSIZE1 selects the parallelism used by the non-volatile memory during write and erase operations to bank 1. PSIZE1 can be programmed only when LOCK1 is cleared to 0.

00: programming executed with byte parallelism

01: programming executed with half-word parallelism

10: programming executed with word parallelism

11: programming executed with double word parallelism

#### Bit 3 **BER1**: Bank 1 erase request

Setting BER1 bit to 1 requests a bank erase operation on bank 1 (user flash memory only). BER1 can be programmed only when LOCK1 is cleared to 0.

BER1 has a higher priority than SER1: if both are set, the embedded flash memory executes a bank erase.

0: bank erase not requested on bank 1

1: bank erase requested on bank 1

*Note: Write protection error is triggered when a bank erase is required and some sectors are protected.*

![](_page_58_Picture_20.jpeg)

#### Bit 2 **SER1**: Bank 1 sector erase request

Setting SER1 bit to 1 requests a sector erase on bank 1. SER1 can be programmed only when LOCK1 is cleared to 0.

BER1 has a higher priority than SER1: if both bits are set, the embedded flash memory executes a bank erase.

0: sector erase not requested on bank 1

1: sector erase requested on bank 1

*Note: Write protection error is triggered when a sector erase is required on a protected sector.*

#### Bit 1 **PG1**: Bank 1 internal buffer control bit

Setting PG1 bit to 1 enables internal buffer for write operations to bank 1. This allows preparing program operations even if a sector or bank erase is ongoing.

PG1 can be programmed only when LOCK1 is cleared to 0. When PG1 is reset, the internal buffer is disabled for write operations to bank 1, and all the data stored in the buffer but not sent to the operation queue are lost.

0: Internal buffer disabled for write operations to bank 1

1: Internal buffer enabled for write operations to bank 1

#### Bit 0 **LOCK1**: Bank 1 configuration lock bit

This bit locks the FLASH\_CR1 register. The correct write sequence to FLASH\_KEYR1 register unlocks this bit. If a wrong sequence is executed, or if the unlock sequence to FLASH\_KEYR1 is performed twice, this bit remains locked until the next system reset. LOCK1 can be set by programming it to 1. When set to 1, a new unlock sequence is mandatory to unlock it. When LOCK1 changes from 0 to 1, the other bits of FLASH\_CR1 register do not change.

0: FLASH\_CR1 register unlocked

1: FLASH\_CR1 register locked

#### Bit 31 **SWAP\_BANK**: Bank swapping option configuration bit

SWAP\_BANK controls whether bank 1 and bank 2 are swapped or not. This bit is loaded with the SWAP\_BANK\_OPT bit of FLASH\_OPTSR\_CUR register only after reset or POR.

0: bank 1 and bank 2 not swapped

1: bank 1 and bank 2 swapped

### Bit 30 **OPTCHANGEERRIE**: Option byte change error interrupt enable bit

OPTCHANGEERRIE bit controls if an interrupt has to be generated when an error occurs during an option byte change.

0: no interrupt is generated when an error occurs during an option byte change

1: an interrupt is generated when and error occurs during an option byte change.

Bits 29:5 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

### Bit 4 **MER**: mass erase request

Setting this bit launches a non-volatile memory bank erase on both banks (i.e. mass erase). Programming MER bit to 1 automatically sets BER1, BER2, START1 and START2 to 1. FLASH\_OPTCR, FLASH\_CR1 and FLASH\_CR2 must be unlocked prior to setting MER high.

![](_page_64_Picture_22.jpeg)

#### Bits 3:2 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

#### Bit 1 **OPTSTART**: Option byte start change option configuration bit

OPTSTART triggers an option byte change operation. The user can set OPTSTART only when the OPTLOCK bit is cleared to 0. The embedded flash memory resets OPTSTART when the option byte change operation has been acknowledged.

The user application cannot modify any embedded flash memory register until the option change operation has been completed.

Before setting this bit, the user has to write the required values in the FLASH\_XXX\_PRG registers. The FLASH\_XXX\_PRG registers will be locked until the option byte change operation has been executed in non-volatile memory.

It is not possible to start an option byte change operation if a CRC calculation is ongoing on bank 1 or bank 2. Trying to set OPTSTART when CRC\_BUSY1/2 of FLASH\_SR1/2 register is set has not effect; the option byte change does not start and no error is generated.

#### Bit 0 **OPTLOCK**: FLASH\_OPTCR lock option configuration bit

The OPTLOCK bit locks the FLASH\_OPTCR register as well as all \_PRG registers. The correct write sequence to FLASH\_OPTKEYR register unlocks this bit. If a wrong sequence is executed, or the unlock sequence to FLASH\_OPTKEYR is performed twice, this bit remains locked until next system reset.

It is possible to set OPTLOCK by programming it to 1. When set to 1, a new unlock sequence is mandatory to unlock it. When OPTLOCK changes from 0 to 1, the others bits of FLASH\_OPTCR register do not change.

0: FLASH\_OPTCR register unlocked

1: FLASH\_OPTCR register locked.

- Bits 31:23 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.
  - Bit 22 **ALL\_BANK**: Bank 1 CRC select bit

When ALL\_BANK is set to 1, all bank 1 user sectors are added to list of sectors on which the CRC is calculated.

Bits 21:20 **CRC\_BURST**: Bank 1 CRC burst size

CRC\_BURST bits set the size of the bursts that are generated by the CRC calculation unit.

00: every burst has a size of 4 flash words (256-bit)

01: every burst has a size of 16 flash words (256-bit)

10: every burst has a size of 64 flash words (256-bit)

11: every burst has a size of 256 flash words (256-bit)

- Bits 19:18 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.
  - Bit 17 **CLEAN\_CRC**: Bank 1 CRC clear bit

Setting CLEAN\_CRC to 1 clears the current CRC result stored in the FLASH\_CRCDATAR register.

Bit 16 **START\_CRC**: Bank 1 CRC start bit

START\_CRC bit triggers a CRC calculation on bank 1 using the current configuration. No CRC calculation can launched when an option byte change operation is ongoing because all write accesses to embedded flash memory registers are put on hold until the option byte change operation has completed.

- Bits 15:11 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.
  - Bit 10 **CLEAN\_SECT**: Bank 1 CRC sector list clear bit

Setting CLEAN\_SECT to 1 clears the list of sectors on which the CRC is calculated.

Bit 9 **ADD\_SECT**: Bank 1 CRC sector select bit

Setting ADD\_SECT to 1 adds the sector whose number is CRC\_SECT to the list of sectors on which the CRC is calculated.

Bit 8 **CRC\_BY\_SECT**: Bank 1 CRC sector mode select bit

When CRC\_BY\_SECT is set to 1, the CRC calculation is performed at sector level, on the sectors present in the list of sectors. To add a sector to this list, use ADD\_SECT and CRC\_SECT bits. To clean the list, use CLEAN\_SECT bit.

When CRC\_BY\_SECT is reset to 0, the CRC calculation is performed on all addresses between CRC\_START\_ADDR and CRC\_END\_ADDR.

- Bits 7:3 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.
- Bits 2:0 **CRC\_SECT**: Bank 1 CRC sector number

CRC\_SECT is used to select one or more user flash sectors to be added to the list of sectors on which the CRC is calculated. The CRC can be computed either between two addresses (using registers FLASH\_CRCSADD1R and FLASH\_CRCEADD1R) or on a list of sectors. If this latter option is selected, it is possible to add a sector to the list of sectors by programming the sector number in CRC\_SECT and then setting ADD\_SECT to 1.

The list of sectors can be erased either by setting CLEAN\_SECT bit or by disabling the CRC computation. CRC\_SECT can be set only when CRC\_EN of FLASH\_CR register is set to 1.

000: sector 0 of bank 1 001: sector 1 of bank 1

...

111: sector 7 of bank 1

#### Bits 14:0 **FAIL\_ECC\_ADDR1**: Bank 1 ECC error address

When an ECC error occurs (both for single correction or double detection) during a read operation from bank 1, the FAIL\_ECC\_ADDR1 bitfield indicates the address that generated the error:

Fail address = FAIL\_ECC\_ADDR1 \* 32 + flash memory Bank 1 address offset FAIL\_ECC\_ADDR1 is reset when the flag error in the FLASH\_SR1 register (CLR\_SNECCERR1 or CLR\_DBECCERR1) is reset.

The embedded flash memory programs the address in this register only when no ECC error flags are set. This means that only the first address that generated an ECC error is saved. The address in FAIL\_ECC\_ADDR1 is relative to the flash memory area where the error occurred (user flash memory, system flash memory).

# **4.9.26 FLASH key register for bank 2 (FLASH\_KEYR2)**

Address offset: 0x104

Reset value: 0x0000 0000

FLASH\_KEYR2 is a write-only register. The following values must be programmed consecutively to unlock FLASH\_CR2 register and allow programming/erasing it:

1. 1st key = 0x4567 0123

2. 2nd key = 0xCDEF 89AB

000: sector 0 of bank 2 001: sector 1 of bank 2

...

111: sector 7 of bank 2

### Bit 7 **START2**: Bank 2 erase start control bit

START2 bit is used to start a sector erase or a bank erase operation. START2 can be programmed only when LOCK2 is cleared to 0.

The embedded flash memory resets START2 when the corresponding operation has been acknowledged. The user application cannot access any embedded flash memory register until the operation is acknowledged.

### Bit 6 **FW2**: Bank 2 write forcing control bit

FW2 forces a write operation even if the write buffer is not full. FW2 can be programmed only when LOCK2 is cleared to 0.

The embedded flash memory resets FW2 when the corresponding operation has been acknowledged. The user application cannot access any flash register until the operation is acknowledged.

Write forcing is effective only if the write buffer is not empty. In particular, FW2 does not start several write operations when the write operations are performed consecutively.

### Bits 5:4 **PSIZE2**: Bank 2 program size

PSIZE2 selects the maximum number of bits that can be written to 0 in one shot during a write operation (programming parallelism). PSIZE2 can be programmed only when LOCK2 is cleared to 0.

00: programming parallelism is byte (8 bits)

01: programming parallelism is half-word (16 bits)

10: programming parallelism is word (32 bits)

11: programming parallelism is double-word (64 bits)

#### Bit 3 **BER2**: Bank 2 erase request

Setting BER2 bit to 1 requests a bank erase operation on bank 2 (user flash memory only). BER2 can be programmed only when LOCK2 is cleared to 0.

BER2 has a higher priority than SER2: if both are set, the embedded flash memory executes a bank erase.

0: bank erase not requested on bank 2

1: bank erase requested on bank 2

*Note: Write protection error is triggered when a bank erase is required and some sectors are protected.*

#### Bit 2 **SER2**: Bank 2 sector erase request

Setting SER2 bit to 1 requests a sector erase on bank 2. SER2 can be programmed only when LOCK2 is cleared to 0.

BER2 has a higher priority than SER2: if both are set, the embedded flash memory executes a bank erase.

0: sector erase not requested on bank 2

1: sector erase requested on bank 2

*Note: Write protection error is triggered when a sector erase is required on protected sector(s).*

#### Bit 1 **PG2**: Bank 2 internal buffer control bit

Setting PG2 bit to 1 enables internal buffer for write operations to bank 2. This allows the preparation of program operations even if a sector or bank erase is ongoing.

PG2 can be programmed only when LOCK2 is cleared to 0. When PG2 is reset, the internal buffer is disabled for write operations to bank 2 and all the data stored in the buffer but not sent to the operation queue are lost.

#### Bit 0 **LOCK2**: Bank 2 configuration lock bit

This bit locks the FLASH\_CR2 register. The correct write sequence to FLASH\_KEYR2 register unlocks this bit. If a wrong sequence is executed, or the unlock sequence to FLASH\_KEYR2 is performed twice, this bit remains locked until next system reset. LOCK2 can be set by programming it to 1. When set to 1, a new unlock sequence is mandatory to unlock it. When LOCK2 changes from 0 to 1, the other bits of FLASH\_CR2 register do not change.

0: FLASH\_CR2 register unlocked

1: FLASH\_CR2 register locked

00: every burst has a size of 4 flash words (256-bit)

01: every burst has a size of 16 flash words (256-bit)

10: every burst has a size of 64 flash words (256-bit)

11: every burst has a size of 256 flash words (256-bit)

Bits 19:18 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

Bit 17 **CLEAN\_CRC**: Bank 2 CRC clear bit

Setting CLEAN\_CRC to 1 clears the current CRC result stored in the FLASH\_CRCDATAR register.

Bit 16 **START\_CRC**: Bank 2 CRC start bit

START\_CRC bit triggers a CRC calculation on bank 2 using the current configuration. It is not possible to start a CRC calculation when an option byte change operation is ongoing because all write accesses to embedded flash memory registers are put on hold until the option byte change operation has completed.

Bits 15:11 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

Bit 10 **CLEAN\_SECT**: Bank 2 CRC sector list clear bit

Setting CLEAN\_SECT to 1 clears the list of sectors on which the CRC is calculated.

Bit 9 **ADD\_SECT**: Bank 2 CRC sector select bit

Setting ADD\_SECT to 1 adds the sector whose number is CRC\_SECT to the list of sectors on which the CRC is calculated.

#### Bit 8 **CRC\_BY\_SECT**: Bank 2 CRC sector mode select bit

When CRC\_BY\_SECT is set to 1, the CRC calculation is performed at sector level, on the sectors selected by CRC\_SECT.

When CRC\_BY\_SECT is reset to 0, the CRC calculation is performed on all addresses between CRC\_START\_ADDR and CRC\_END\_ADDR.

Bits 7:3 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

#### Bits 2:0 **CRC\_SECT**: Bank 2 CRC sector number

CRC\_SECT is used to select one or more user flash sectors to be added to the CRC calculation. The CRC can be computed either between two addresses (using registers FLASH\_CRCSADD2R and FLASH\_CRCEADD2R) or on a list of sectors. If this latter option is selected, it is possible to add a sector to the list of sectors by programming the sector number in CRC\_SECT and then setting ADD\_SECT. to 1

The list of sectors can be erased either by setting CLEAN\_SECT bit or by disabling the CRC computation. CRC\_SECT can be set only when CRC\_EN of FLASH\_CR register is set to 1.

000: sector 0 of bank 2 001: sector 1 of bank 2

...

111: sector 7 of bank 2

### Bits 14:0 **FAIL\_ECC\_ADDR2**: Bank 2 ECC error address

When an ECC error occurs (both for single error correction or double detection) during a read operation from bank 2, the FAIL\_ECC\_ADDR2 bitfield indicates the address that generated the error:

Fail address = FAIL\_ECC\_ADDR2 \* 32 + flash memory Bank 2 address offset FAIL\_ECC\_ADDR2 is reset when the flag error in the FLASH\_SR2 register (CLR\_SNECCERR2 or CLR\_DBECCERR2) is reset.

The embedded flash memory programs the address in this register only when no ECC error flags are set. This means that only the first address that generated an ECC error is saved.
