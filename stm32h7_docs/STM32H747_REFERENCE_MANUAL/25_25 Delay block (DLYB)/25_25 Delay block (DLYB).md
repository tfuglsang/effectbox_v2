RM0399 Delay block (DLYB)

# 25 Delay block (DLYB)

#### 25.1 Introduction

The delay block (DLYB) is used to generate an output clock that is dephased from the input clock. The phase of the output clock must be programmed by the user application. The output clock is then used to clock the data received by another peripheral such as an SDMMC or Quad-SPI interface.

The delay is voltage- and temperature-dependent, that may require the application to reconfigure and recenter the output clock phase with the receive data.

#### 25.2 DLYB main features

The delay block has the following features:

- Input clock frequency ranging from 25 MHz to the maximum frequency supported by the communication interface (see datasheet)
- Up to 12 oversampling phases.

#### **25.3.3 General description**

The delay block is enabled by setting the DEN bit in the DLYB control register (DLYB\_CR). The length sampler is enabled through the SEN bit in DLYB\_CR register.

When the delay block is enabled, the delay added by a unit delay is defined by the UNIT[6:0] field in the DLYB configuration register (DLYB\_CFGR).

*Note: UNIT[6:0] can be programmed only when the output clock is disabled (SEN = 1).*

When the delay block is enabled, the output clock phase is selected through the SEL[3:0] field in DLYB\_CFGR register.

*Note: SEL can be programmed only when the output clock is disabled (SEN = 1).*

The output clock can be de-phased over one input clock period by configuring the delay line length to span one period. The delay line length can be configured by enabling the length sampler through the SEN bit, that gives access to the delay line length (LNG[11:0]) and length valid flag (LNGF) in DLYB\_CFGR.

If an output clock delay smaller than one input clock period is needed the delay line length can be reduced. This allows a smaller unit delay providing higher resolution.

Once the delay line length is configured, a dephased output clock can be selected by the output clock multiplexer. This is done through SEL[3:0]. The output clock is only available on the selected phase when SEN is set to 0.

The table below gives a summary of the delay block control.

**Table 206. Delay block control**

| DEN | SEN | UNIT          | SEL                   | LNG           | LNGF        | Output clock               |
|-----|-----|---------------|-----------------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 0   | 0   | Don't care    | Don't care            | Don't<br>care | Don't care  | Enabled (= Input clock)    |
| x   | 1   | Unit delay    | Output clock phase    | Length        | Length flag | Disabled                   |
| 1   | 0   | Unit delay(1) | Output clock phase(2) | Don't<br>care | Don't care  | Enabled (= selected phase) |

<sup>1.</sup> The unit delay can only be changed when SEN = 1.

## **25.3.4 Delay line length configuration procedure**

LNG[11:0] is used to determine the delay line length with respect to the input clock period. The length must be configured so that one full input clock period is covered by the delay line length.

Note that despite the delay line has 12 unit delay elements, the following procedure description returns a length between 0 and 10, as the upper delay output value is used to ensure that the delay is calibrated over one full input clock cycle. Depending on the clock frequency and UNIT value, unit delay element 10 may also be truncated from the clock cycle length.

A clock input (free running clock) must be present during the whole tuning procedure.

To configure the delay line length to one period of the Input clock, follow the sequence below:

- 1. Enable the delay block by setting DEN bit to 1.
- 2. Enable the length sampling by setting SEN bit to 1.
- 3. Enable all delay cells by setting SEL[3:0] to 12.
- 4. For UNIT[6:0] = 0 to 127 (this step must be repeated until the delay line length is configured):
  - a) Update the UNIT[6:0] value and wait till the length flag LNGF is set to 1.
  - b) Read LNG[11:0].
  - If (LNG[10:0] > 0) and (LNG[11] or LNG[10] = 0), the delay line length is configured to one input clock period.
- 5. Determine how many unit delays (N) span one input clock period: for N = 0 to 10, if LNG[N] = 1, the number of unit delays spanning the input clock period = N.
- 6. Disable the length sampling by clearing SEN to 0.

If an output clock delay smaller than one input clock period is needed the delay line length can be reduced smaller than one input clock period. This allows a smaller unit delay, providing a higher resolution spanning a shorter time interval.

## **25.3.5 Output clock phase configuration procedure**

When the delay line length is configured to one input clock period, the output clock phase can be selected between the unit delays spanning one Input clock period.

Follow the steps below to select the output clock phase:

- 1. Disable the output clock and enable the access to the phase selection SEL[3:0] bits by setting SEN bit to 1.
- 2. Program SEL[3:0] with the desired output clock phase value.
- 3. Enable the output clock on the selected phase by clearing SEN to 0.

#### SDMMC use case:

The delay block is used in conjunction with SDMMC interface variable delay. For correct sampling point tuning the delay value must cover a whole SDMMC\_CK clock period. After having tuned the delay line length the individual delays are used in the sampling point tuning to find the optimal sampling point.
