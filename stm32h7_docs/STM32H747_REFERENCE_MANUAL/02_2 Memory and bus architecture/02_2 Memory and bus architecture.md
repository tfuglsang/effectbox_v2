## **2.1.1 Bus matrices**

### **AXI bus matrix in D1 domain**

The D1 domain multi AXI bus matrix ensures and arbitrates concurrent accesses from multiple masters to multiple slaves. This allows efficient simultaneous operation of highspeed peripherals.

The arbitration uses a round-robin algorithm with QoS capability.

Refer to *[Section 2.2: AXI interconnect matrix \(AXIM\)](#page-6-0)* for more information on AXI interconnect.

## **AHB bus matrices in D2 and D3 domains**

The AHB bus matrices in D2 and D3 domains ensure and arbitrate concurrent accesses from multiple masters to multiple slaves. This allows efficient simultaneous operation of high-speed peripherals.

The arbitration uses a round-robin algorithm.

### **2.1.2 TCM buses**

The DTCM and ITCM (data and instruction tightly coupled RAMs) are connected through dedicated TCM buses directly to the Cortex-M7 core. The MDMA controller can access the DTCM and ITCM through AHBS, a specific CPU slave AHB. The ITCM is accessed by Cortex-M7 at CPU clock speed, with zero wait states.

### **2.1.3 Bus-to-bus bridges**

To allow peripherals with different types of buses to communicate together, there is a number of bus-to-bus bridges in the system.

The AHB/APB bridges in D1 and D3 domains allow connecting peripherals on APB3 and APB4 to AHB3 and AHB4, respectively. The AHB/APB bridges in D2 domain allow peripherals on APB1 and APB2 to connect to AHB1. These AHB/APB bridges provide full synchronous interfacing, which allows the APB peripherals to operate with clocks independent of AHB that they connect to.

The AHB/APB bridges also allow APB1 and APB2 peripherals to connect to DMA1 and DMA2 peripheral buses, respectively, without transiting through AHB1.

The AHB/APB bridges convert 8-bit / 16-bit APB data to 32-bit AHB data, by replicating it to the three upper bytes / the upper half-word of the 32-bit word.

The AXI bus matrix incorporates AHB/AXI bus bridge functionality on its slave bus interfaces. The AXI/AHB bus bridges on its master interfaces marked as 32-bit in *[Figure 1](#page-1-0)* are outside the matrix.

The Cortex-M7 CPU provides AHB/TCM-bus (ITCM and DTCM buses) translation from its AHBS slave AHB, allowing the MDMA controller to access the ITCM and DTCM.

## **2.1.4 ART accelerator**

Reduced ART (adaptive real-time) memory access accelerator stands between the D2-to-D1 AHB and the AXI bus matrix. It accelerates cacheable AHB instruction fetch accesses, using a dedicated 64-bit AXI bus matrix port to pre-fetch code from the internal and external memories of the D1 domain into a built-in cache. It routes all the other AHB accesses to a dedicated 32-bit AXI bus matrix port connecting the D2-to-D1 AHB with all the internal and external memories and peripherals of the D1 domain excluding GPV, as well as with the D1 to-D3 AHB.

## **2.1.5 Inter-domain buses**

#### **D2-to-D1 AHB**

This 32-bit bus connects the D2 domain to the AXI bus matrix in the D1 domain. It allows bus masters in the D2 domain to access resources (bus slaves) in the D1 domain and indirectly, via the D1-to-D3 AHB, in the D3 domain.

#### **D1-to-D2 AHB**

This 32-bit bus connects the D1 domain to the D2 domain AHB bus matrix. It allows bus masters in the D1 domain to access resources (bus slaves) in the D2 domain.

The AXIM bus connects the CPU to the AXI bus matrix in the D1 domain.

## **Cortex®-M7 ITCM bus**

The Cortex®-M7 CPU uses the 64-bit ITCM bus for fetching instructions from and accessing data in the ITCM.

## **Cortex®-M7 DTCM bus**

The Cortex®-M7 CPU uses the 2x32-bit DTCM bus for accessing data in the DTCM. The 2x32-bit DTCM bus allows load/load and load/store instruction pairs to be dual-issued on the DTCM memory. It can also fetch instructions.

## **Cortex®-M4 D-bus**

The Cortex®-M4 CPU uses the 32-bit D-bus, via AHB bus matrix, for literal load and debug access to memories containing code or data and mapped on addresses below 0x2000 0000: the internal SRAM1, SRAM2, SRAM3, and the internal Flash memory.

## **Cortex®-M4 S-bus**

The Cortex®-M4 CPU uses the 32-bit S-bus, via the AHB bus matrix in D2 domain, to access all memories and all peripherals in the device mapped on addresses above 0x2000 0000. It can also handle instruction fetching, although less efficiently than the I-bus.

## **2.1.7 Bus master peripherals**

## **SDMMC1**

The SDMMC1 uses a 32-bit bus, connected to the AXI bus matrix, through which it can access internal AXI SRAM and Flash memories, and external memories through the Quad-SPI controller and the FMC.

#### **MDMA controller**

The MDMA controller has two bus masters: an AXI 64-bit bus, connected to the AXI bus matrix and an AHB 32-bit bus connected to the Cortex-M7 AHBS slave bus.

The MDMA is optimized for DMA data transfers between memories since it supports linked list transfers that allow performing a chained list of transfers without the need for CPU intervention. Through the system bus matrices and the Cortex-M7 AHBS slave bus, the MDMA can access all internal and external memories through the Quad-SPI controller and the FMC.

![](_page_4_Picture_21.jpeg)

#### **DMA1 and DMA2 controllers**

The DMA1 and DMA2 controllers have two 32-bit buses - memory bus and peripheral bus, connected to the AHB bus matrix in D2 domain.

The memory bus allows DMA data transfers between memories. Through the system bus matrices, the memory bus can access all internal memories except ITCM and DTCM, and external memories through the Quad-SPI controller and the FMC.

The peripheral bus allows DMA data transfers between two peripherals, between two memories or between a peripheral and a memory. Through the system bus matrices, the peripheral bus can access all internal memories except ITCM and DTCM, external memories through the Quad-SPI controller and the FMC, and all AHB and APB peripherals. A direct access to APB1 and APB2 is available, without passing through AHB1. Direct path to APB1 and APB2 bridges allows reducing the bandwidth usage on AHB1 bus by improving data treatment efficiency for APB and AHB peripherals.

#### **BDMA controller**

The BDMA controller uses a 32-bit bus, connected to the AHB bus matrix in D3 domain, for DMA data transfers between two peripherals, between two memories or between a peripheral and a memory. BDMA transfers are limited to the D3 domain resources. It can access the internal SRAM4, backup RAM, and AHB4 and APB4 peripherals through the AHB bus matrix in the D3 domain.

#### **Chrom-Art Accelerator (DMA2D)**

#### **Ethernet MAC**

The Ethernet MAC uses a 32-bit bus, connected to the AHB bus matrix in the D2 domain. Through the system bus matrices, it can access all internal memories except ITCM and DTCM, and external memories through the Quad-SPI controller and the FMC.

#### **USBHS1 and USBHS2 peripherals**

The USBHS1 and USBHS2 peripherals use 32-bit buses, connected to the AHB bus matrix in the D2 domain. Through the system bus matrices, they can access all internal memories except ITCM and DTCM, and external memories through the Quad-SPI controller and the FMC.

### **2.1.8 Clocks to functional blocks**

Upon reset, clocks to blocks such as peripherals and some memories are disabled (except for the SRAM, DTCM, ITCM and Flash memory). To operate a block with no clock upon reset, the software must first enable its clock through RCC\_AHBxENR or RCC\_APBxENR register, respectively.

## <span id="page-6-0"></span>**2.2 AXI interconnect matrix (AXIM)**

## **2.2.1 AXI introduction**

The AXI (advanced extensible interface) interconnect is based on the Arm® CoreLink™ NIC-400 Network Interconnect. The interconnect has seven initiator ports, or ASIBs (AMBA slave interface blocks), and seven target ports, or AMIBs (AMBA master interface blocks). The ASIBs are connected to the AMIBs via an AXI switch matrix.

Each ASIB is a slave on an AXI bus or AHB (advanced high-performance bus). Similarly, each AMIB is a master on an AXI or AHB bus. Where an ASIB or AMIB is connected to an AHB, it converts between the AHB and the AXI protocol.

The AXI interconnect includes a GPV (global programmer view) which contains registers for configuring certain parameters, such as the QoS (quality of service) level at each ASIB.

Any accesses to unallocated address space are handled by the default slave, which generates the return signals. This ensures that such transactions complete and do not block the issuing master and ASIB.

### **2.2.2 AXI interconnect main features**

- 64-bit AXI bus switch matrix with seven ASIBs and seven AMIBs, in D1 domain
- AHB/AXI bridge function built into the ASIBs
- concurrent connectivity of multiple ASIBs to multiple AMIBs
- programmable traffic priority management (QoS quality of service)
- software-configurable via GPV

<span id="page-8-0"></span><sup>1.</sup> Conversion to AHB protocol is done via an AXI/AHB bridge sitting between AXI interconnect and the connected slave.

#### **Quality of service (QoS)**

The AXI switch matrix uses a priority-based arbitration when two ASIB simultaneously attempt to access the same AMIB. Each ASIB has programmable read channel and write channel priorities, known as QoS, from 0 to 15, such that the higher the value, the higher the priority. The read channel QoS value is programmed in the *[AXI interconnect - INI x read](#page-16-0)  [QoS register \(AXI\\_INIx\\_READ\\_QOS\)](#page-16-0)*, and the write channel in the *[AXI interconnect - INI x](#page-17-0)  [write QoS register \(AXI\\_INIx\\_WRITE\\_QOS\)](#page-17-0)*. The default QoS value for all channels is 0 (lowest priority).

If two coincident transactions arrive at the same AMIB, the higher priority transaction passes before the lower priority. If the two transactions have the same QoS value, then a leastrecently-used (LRU) priority scheme is adopted.

The QoS values should be programmed according to the latency requirements for the application. Setting a higher priority for an ASIB ensures a lower latency for transactions initiated by the associated bus master. This can be useful for real-time-constrained tasks, such as graphics processing (LTDC, DMA2D). Assigning a high priority to masters that can make many and frequent accesses to the same slave (such as the Cortex-M7 CPU) can block access to that slave by other lower-priority masters.

#### **Global programmer view (GPV)**

The GPV contains configuration registers for the AXI interconnect (see *[Section 2.2.4](#page-9-0)*). These registers are only accessible by the Cortex-M7 CPU.

## <span id="page-26-0"></span>**2.3 Memory organization**

### **2.3.1 Introduction**

Program memory, data memory, registers and I/O ports are organized within the same linear 4-Gbyte address space.

The bytes are coded in memory in Little Endian format. The lowest numbered byte in a word is considered the word's least significant byte and the highest numbered byte the most significant.

The addressable memory space is divided into eight main blocks, of 512 Mbytes each.

## **2.4 Embedded SRAM**

The STM32H745/55/47/57xx devices feature:

- Up to 864 Kbytes of System SRAM
- 128 Kbytes of data TCM RAM
- 64 Kbytes of instruction TCM RAM
- 4 Kbytes of backup SRAM

The embedded system SRAM is divided into up to five blocks over the three power domains:

- D1 domain, AXI SRAM:
  - AXI SRAM is mapped at address 0x2400 0000 and accessible by all system masters except BDMA through D1 domain AXI bus matrix. AXI SRAM can be used for application data which are not allocated in DTCM RAM or reserved for graphic objects (such as frame buffers)
- D2 domain, AHB SRAM:
  - AHB SRAM1 is mapped at address 0x3000 0000 and accessible by all system masters except BDMA through D2 domain AHB matrix. AHB SRAM1 can be used as DMA buffers to store peripheral input/output data in D2 domain, or as code location for Cortex®-M4 CPU (application code available when D1 is powered off.
  - AHB SRAM2 is mapped at address 0x3002 0000 and accessible by all system masters except BDMA through D2 domain AHB matrix. AHB SRAM2 can be used as DMA buffers to store peripheral input/output data in D2 domain, or as readwrite segment for application running on Cortex®-M4 CPU.
  - AHB SRAM3 is mapped at address 0x3004 0000 and accessible by all system masters except BDMA through D2 domain AHB matrix. AHB SRAM3 can be used as buffers to store peripheral input/output data for Ethernet and USB, or as shared memory between the two cores.
- D3 domain, AHB SRAM:
  - AHB SRAM4 is mapped at address 0x3800 0000 and accessible by most of system masters through D3 domain AHB matrix. AHB SRAM4 can be used as BDMA buffers to store peripheral input/output data in D3 domain. It can also be used to retain some application code/data when D1 and D2 domain enter DStandby mode, or as shared memory between the two cores.

The AHB SRAMs of the D2 domain are also aliased to an address range below 0x2000 0000 to maintain the Cortex®-M4 Harvard architecture:

- AHB SRAM1 also mapped at address 0x1000 0000 and accessible by all system masters through D2 domain AHB matrix
- AHB SRAM2 also mapped at address 0x1002 0000 and accessible by all system masters through D2 domain AHB matrix
- AHB SRAM3 also mapped at address 0x1004 0000 and accessible by all system masters through D2 domain AHB matrix

The system AHB SRAM can be accessed as bytes, half-words (16-bit units) or words (32-bit units), while the system AXI SRAM can be accessed as bytes, half-words, words or doublewords (64-bit units). These memories can be addressed at maximum system clock frequency without wait state.

![](_page_34_Picture_22.jpeg)

The AHB masters can read/write-access an SRAM section concurrently with the Ethernet MAC or the USB OTG HS peripheral accessing another SRAM section. For example, the Ethernet MAC accesses the SRAM2 while the CPU accesses the SRAM1, concurrently.

The TCM SRAMs are dedicated to the Cortex®-M7:

- DTCM-RAM on TCM interface is mapped at the address 0x2000 0000 and accessible by Cortex<sup>®</sup>-M7, and by MDMA through AHBS slave bus of the Cortex<sup>®</sup>-M7 CPU. The DTCM-RAM can be used as read-write segment to host critical real-time data (such as stack and heap) for application running on Cortex<sup>®</sup>-M7 CPU.
- ITCM-RAM on TCM interface mapped at the address 0x0000 0000 and accessible by Cortex<sup>®</sup>-M7 and by MDMA through AHBS slave bus of the Cortex<sup>®</sup>-M7 CPU. The ITCM-RAM can be used to host code for time-critical routines (such as interrupt handlers) that requires deterministic execution.

The backup RAM is mapped at the address 0x3880 0000 and is accessible by most of the system masters through D3 domain's AHB matrix. With a battery connected to the  $V_{BAT}$  pin, the backup SRAM can be used to retain data during low-power mode (Standby and  $V_{BAT}$  mode).

#### Error code correction (ECC)

SRAM data are protected by ECC:

- 7 ECC bits are added per 32-bit word.
- 8 ECC bits are added per 64-bit word for AXI-SRAM and ITCM-RAM.

The ECC mechanism is based on the SECDED algorithm. It supports single-error correction and double-error detection.

When an incomplete word is written to an internal SRAM and a reset occurs, the last incomplete word is not really written. This is due to the ECC behavior. To ensure that an incomplete word is written to SRAM, write an additional dummy incomplete word to the same RAM at a different address before issuing a reset.

## 2.5 Flash memory overview

The Flash memory interface manages CPU AXI accesses to the Flash memory. It implements the erase and program Flash memory operations and the read and write protection mechanisms.

The Flash memory is organized as follows:

- Two main memory block divided into sectors.
- An information block:
  - System memory from which the device boots in System memory boot mode
  - Option bytes to configure read and write protection, BOR level, watchdog software/hardware and reset when the device is in Standby or Stop mode.

Refer to Section 4: Embedded flash memory (FLASH) for more details.

# 2.6 Boot configuration

In the STM32H745/55/47/57xx, the two cores can boot alone or in the same time according to the option bytes as shown in *Table 8*.

RM0399 Rev 4 143/3556

**Table 8. Boot order** 

<span id="page-36-0"></span>

| BCM7 | BCM4 | Boot order                                          |
|------|------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | 0    | Cortex®-M7 is booting and Cortex®-M4 clock is gated |
| 0    | 1    | Cortex®-M7 clock is gated and Cortex®-M4 is booting |
| 1    | 0    | Cortex®-M7 is booting and Cortex®-M4 clock is gated |
| 1    | 1    | Both Cortex®-M7 and Cortex®-M4 are booting          |

Two different boot areas per core can be selected through the BOOT pin and the boot base address programmed, as shown in the *[Table 9](#page-36-1)*, in the:

- BCM7\_ADD0 and BCM7\_ADD1 option bytes for Cortex®-M7
- BCM4\_ADD0 and BCM4\_ADD1 option bytes for Cortex®-M4

**Table 9. Boot modes** 

<span id="page-36-1"></span>

| Boot mode selection |                              |                                                                                                                                    |

| 0                   | BCM7_ADD0[15:0]              | Cortex®-M7 boot address defined by user option byte<br>BCM7_ADD0[15:0] ST programmed value:<br>Flash memory at 0x0800 0000         |
|                     | BCM4_ADD0[15:0]              | Cortex®-M4 boot address defined by user option byte<br>BCM4_ADD0[15:0] ST programmed value:<br>Flash memory at 0x0810 0000         |
| 1                   | BCM7_ADD1[15:0]              | Cortex®-M7 boot address defined by user option byte<br>BCM7_ADD1[15:0] ST programmed value:<br>TCM-RAM at 0x000 0000 or bootloader |
|                     | BCM4_ADD1[15:0]              | Cortex®-M4 boot address defined by user option byte<br>BCM4_ADD1[15:0] ST programmed value:<br>SRAM1 at 0x1000 0000                |

The values on the BOOT pin are latched on the 4th rising edge of SYSCLK after reset release. It is up to the user to set the BOOT pin after reset.

The BOOT pin is also re-sampled when the device exits the Standby mode. Consequently, they must be kept in the required Boot mode configuration when the device is in the Standby mode.

After startup delay, the selection of the boot area is done before releasing the processor reset.

The BOOT\_ADD0 and BOOT\_ADD1 address option bytes allows to program any boot memory address from 0x0000 0000 to 0x3FFF 0000 which includes:

- All Flash address space
- All RAM address space: ITCM, DTCM RAMs and SRAMs
- The TCM-RAM

![](_page_36_Picture_16.jpeg)

The BCM4\_ADD0 and BCM4\_ADD1 address option bytes allows to program any boot memory address from 0x0000 0000 to 0x3FFF 0000 which includes:

- all Flash memory address space
- all system RAM address space
- SRAM1

The BOOT\_ADD0 / BOOT\_ADD1 / BCM4\_ADD0 / BCM4\_ADD1 option bytes can be modified after reset in order to boot from any other boot address after next reset.

If the programmed boot memory address is out of the memory mapped area or a reserved area, the default boot fetch address is programmed as follows:

- Cortex®-M7 Boot address 0: FLASH at 0x0800 0000
- Cortex®-M7 Boot address 1: ITCM-RAM at 0x0000 0000
- Cortex®-M4 Boot address 0: FLASH at 0x0810 0000
- Cortex®-M4 Boot address 1: SRAM1 at 0x1000 0000

When the Flash level 2 protection is enabled, only boot from Flash memory is available. If the boot address already programmed in the BOOT\_ADD0 / BOOT\_ADD1 / BCM4\_ADD0 / BCM4\_ADD1 option bytes is out of the memory range or belongs to the RAM address range, the default fetch will be forced from Flash memory at address 0x0800 0000 for Cortex®-M7 and Flash at address 0x0810 0000 for Cortex®-M4.

#### **Embedded bootloader**

The embedded bootloader code is located in system memory. It is programmed by ST during production. It is used to reprogram the Flash memory using one of the following serial interfaces:

- USART1 on PA9/PA10 and PB14/PB15 pins, USART2 on PA3/PA2 pins, and USART3 on PB10/PB11 pins.
- I2C1 on PB6/PB9 pins, I2C2 on PF0/PF1 pins, and I2C3 on PA8/PC9 pins.
- USB OTG FS in Device mode (DFU) on PA11/PA12 pins
- SPI1 on PA4/PA5/PA6/PA7 pins, SPI2 on PI0/PI1/PI2/PI3 pins, SPI3 on PC10/PC11/PC12/PA15 pins, and SPI4 on PE11/PE12/PE13/PE14 pins.
